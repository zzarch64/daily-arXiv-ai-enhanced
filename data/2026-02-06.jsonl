Preprint version", "summary": "This work presents the first design, integration, and evaluation of the standard RISC-V extensions for Control-Flow Integrity (CFI). The Zicfiss and Zicfilp extensions aim at protecting the execution of a vulnerable program from control-flow hijacking attacks through the implementation of security mechanisms based on shadow stack and landing pad primitives. We introduce two independent and configurable hardware units implementing forward-edge and backward-edge control-flow protection, fully integrated into the open-source CVA6 core. Our design incurs in only 1.0% area overhead when synthesized in 22 nm FDX technology, and up to 15.6% performance overhead based on evaluation with the MiBench automotive benchmark subset. We release the complete implementation as open source."}

While emerging technologies, such as emerging non-volatile memories (eNVM), offer a promising solution to energy efficient computing, their end-to-end footprint is not well understood. Understanding the environmental impact of hardware systems over their life cycle is the first step to realizing sustainable computing. This work conducts a detailed study of one example eNVM device: hafnium-zirconium-oxide (HZO)-based ferroelectric field-effect transistors (FeFETs). We present COFFEE, the first carbon modeling framework for HZO-based FeFET eNVMs across life cycle, from hardware manufacturing (embodied carbon) to use (operational carbon). COFFEE builds on data gathered from a real semiconductor fab and device fabrication recipes to estimate embodied carbon, and architecture level eNVM design space exploration tools to quantify use-phase performance and energy. Our evaluation shows that, at 2 MB capacity, the embodied carbon per unit area overhead of HZO-FeFETs can be up to 11% higher than the CMOS baseline, while the embodied carbon per MB remains consistently about 4.3x lower than SRAM across different memory capacity. A further case study applies COFFEE to an edge ML accelerator, showing that replacing the SRAM-based weight buffer with HZO-based FeFET eNVMs reduces embodied carbon by 42.3% and operational carbon by up to 70%."}

However, existing digital compute-in-memory (DCIM) architectures face challenges in supporting variable FP8 aligned-mantissa bitwidths, as unified alignment strategies and fixed-precision multiply-accumulate (MAC) units struggle to handle input data with diverse distributions. This work presents a flexible FP8 DCIM accelerator with three innovations: (1) a dynamic shift-aware bitwidth prediction (DSBP) with on-the-fly input prediction that adaptively adjusts weight (2/4/6/8b) and input (2$\\sim$12b) aligned-mantissa precision; (2) a FIFO-based input alignment unit (FIAU) replacing complex barrel shifters with pointer-based control; and (3) a precision-scalable INT MAC array achieving flexible weight precision with minimal overhead. Implemented in 28nm CMOS with a 64$\\times$96 CIM array, the design achieves 20.4 TFLOPS/W for fixed E5M7, demonstrating 2.8$\\times$ higher FP8 efficiency than previous work while supporting all FP8 formats. Results on Llama-7b show that the DSBP achieves higher efficiency than fixed bitwidth mode at the same accuracy level on both BoolQ and Winogrande datasets, with configurable parameters enabling flexible accuracy-efficiency trade-offs."}
