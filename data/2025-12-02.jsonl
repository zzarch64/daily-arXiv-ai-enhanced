Aim to submit to IEEE TCAD", "summary": "Software-defined radio (SDR) plays an important role in the communication field by providing a flexible and customized communication system for different purposes according to the needs. To enhance the performance of SDR applications, hardware accelerators have been widely deployed in recent years. In facing this obstacle, a necessity arises for a high-level synthesis (HLS) tool specifically designed for communication engineers without detailed hardware knowledge. To lower the barrier between SDR engineers and hardware development, this work proposed a Python-based HLS tool, VeriPy, which can generate both mainstream architecture for hardware accelerators in Verilog specifically for SDR designs including unrolled design and pipelined design, requiring no detailed digital hardware knowledge or Hardware Description Languages (HDL). Furthermore, VeriPy supports automatic testbench generation with random input stimulus, an extensible hardware library, performance and resource estimation, and offers strong optimisation potential at both the algorithmic and digital hardware levels. The generated hardware design by VeriPy can achieve up to 70% faster operating frequency compared to pragma-optimised Vivado HLS designs with a reasonably higher resource con-sumption while delivering comparable performance and resource consumption to hand-coded implementations. Regarding code complexity, VeriPy requires no pragmas, completely eliminating the need for low-level hardware knowledge. For straightforward algorithms, the input code length remains comparable to that of Vivado HLS."}

With the advent of generative AI various attempts have been made to automate parts of the design and verification process. Large language models (LLMs) as well as specialized models generate hdl and testbenches for small components, having a few leaf level components. However, there are only a few attempts to automate the entire processor design process. Hardware design demands hierarchical and modular design processes. We utilized this best practice systematically and effectively. We propose agentic automated processor design and verification with engineers in the loop. The agent with optional specification tries to break down the design into sub-components, generate HDL and cocotb tests, and verifies the components involving engineer guidance, especially during debugging and synthesis. We designed various digital systems using this approach. However, we selected two simple processors for demonstration purposes in this work. The first one is a LEGv8 like a simple processor verified, synthesized and programmed for the DE-10 Lite FPGA. The second one is a RISC-V like 32-bit processor designed and verified in similar manner and synthesized. However, it is not programmed into the DE-10 Lite. This process is accomplished usually using around a million inference tokens per processor, using a combination of reasoning (e.g gemini-pro) and non-reasoning models (eg. gpt-5-mini) based on the complexity of the task. This indicates that hardware design and verification experimentation can be done cost effectively without using any specialized hardware. The approach is scalable, we even attempted system-on-chip, which we want to experiment in our future work."}

However, once a device model is widely deployed, the performance of each device becomes different after a period of running. This is caused by the differences in user configurations, environmental conditions, manufacturing variances, battery degradation, etc. Existing DNN compression methods have not taken this scenario into consideration and can not guarantee good compression results in all homogeneous edge devices. To address this, we propose Homogeneous-Device Aware Pruning (HDAP), a hardware-aware DNN compression framework explicitly designed for homogeneous edge devices, aiming to achieve optimal average performance of the compressed model across all devices. To deal with the difficulty of time-consuming hardware-aware evaluations for thousands or millions of homogeneous edge devices, HDAP partitions all the devices into several device clusters, which can dramatically reduce the number of devices to evaluate and use the surrogate-based evaluation instead of hardware evaluation in real-time. Extensive experiments on multiple device types (Jetson Xavier NX and Jetson Nano) and task types (image classification with ResNet50, MobileNetV1, ResNet56, VGG16; object detection with YOLOv8n) demonstrate that HDAP consistently achieves lower average latency and competitive accuracy compared to state-of-the-art methods, with significant speedups (e.g., 2.86$\\times$ on ResNet50 at 1.0G FLOPs).

Within this broader landscape, Verilog, as a representative hardware description language (HDL), plays a fundamental role in digital circuit design and verification, making its automated generation particularly significant for Electronic Design Automation (EDA). Consequently, recent research has increasingly focused on applying Large Language Models (LLMs) to Verilog code generation, particularly at the Register Transfer Level (RTL), exploring how these AI-driven techniques can be effectively integrated into hardware design workflows. Despite substantial research efforts have explored LLM applications in this domain, a comprehensive survey synthesizing these developments remains absent from the literature. This review fill addresses this gap by providing a systematic literature review of LLM-based methods for Verilog code generation, examining their effectiveness, limitations, and potential for advancing automated hardware design. The review encompasses research work from conferences and journals in the fields of SE, AI, and EDA, encompassing 70 papers published on venues, along with 32 high-quality preprint papers, bringing the total to 102 papers. By answering four key research questions, we aim to (1) identify the LLMs used for Verilog generation, (2) examine the datasets and metrics employed in evaluation, (3) categorize the techniques proposed for Verilog generation, and (4) analyze LLM alignment approaches for Verilog generation.

Phase-change memory (PCM) has gained attention as a promising option due to its scalability, fast access speeds, and zero leakage power compared to conventional memory systems. However, despite these advantages, PCM faces several challenges that impede its broader adoption, particularly its limited lifespan due to material degradation during write operations, as well as the high energy demands of these processes. For PCM to become a viable storage alternative, enhancing its endurance and reducing the energy required for write operations are essential. This paper proposes the use of a neural network (NN) model to predict critical parameters such as write latency, energy consumption, and endurance by monitoring real-time operating conditions and device characteristics. These predictions are key to improving PCM performance and identifying optimal write settings, making PCM a more practical and efficient option for data storage in applications with frequent write operations. Our approach leads to significant improvements, with NN predictions achieving a Mean Absolute Percentage Error (MAPE) of 0.0073% for endurance, 0.23% for total write latency, and 4.92% for total write energy."}

This work presents an in-depth analysis of the impact of such faults on the computational pipeline of a Systolic Array based Deep Neural Network accelerator (SA-DNN accelerator) by means of a Register Transfer Level (RTL) Fault Injection (FI) simulation in order to improve the observability of each hardware block. From this analysis, we present the sensitivity to single bit faults of register groups in the pipeline for three different DNN workloads utilising two datasets, namely MNIST and CIFAR-10. These sensitivity figures are presented in terms of Fault Propagation Probability ($P(f_{non-crit})$) and False Classification Probability ($P(f_{crit})$) which respectively show the probability that an injected fault causes a non-critical error (numerical offset) or a critical error (classification fault).

Similarly to the push originating from the RISC-V movement for CPUs, Vortex can enable a myriad of fresh research directions for GPUs. However, as a young hardware platform, it currently lacks the performance competitiveness of commercial GPUs, which is crucial for widespread adoption. State-of-the-art GPUs, in fact, rely on complex architectural features, still unavailable in Vortex, to hide the micro-code overheads linked to control flow (CF) management and memory orchestration for data access. In particular, these components account for the majority of the dynamic instruction count in regular, memory-intensive kernels, such as linear algebra routines, which form the basis of many applications, including Machine Learning. To address these challenges with simple yet powerful micro-architecture modifications, this paper introduces decoupled CF and data access through 1.) a hardware CF manager to accelerate branching and predication in regular loop execution and 2.) decoupled memory streaming lanes to further hide memory latency with useful computation. The evaluation results for different kernels show 8$\\times$ faster execution, 10$\\times$ reduction in dynamic instruction count, and overall performance improvement from 0.35 to 1.63 $\\mathrm{GFLOP/s/mm^2}$.

This paper explores the feasibility of using WASM in embedded IoT systems by evaluating its performance, memory footprint and energy consumption on three representative microcontrollers: the Raspberry Pi Pico, the ESP32 C6 and the nRF5340. Two lightweight WASM runtimes, WAMR and wasm3, are compared with the native C execution. The results show that while the native execution remains superior in terms of speed and energy efficiency, WASM offers acceptable trade-offs in return for cross-platform compatibility and sandbox execution. The results highlight that WASM is a viable option for embedded IoT applications when portability and security outweigh strict performance constraints, and that further runtime optimization could extend its practicality in this area."}

Existing methods face challenges in constructing accurate timing models due to multi-factor nonlinear constraints as well as load and crosstalk coupling effects arising in multi-pin driving scenarios. To address these challenges, we propose TD-Placer, a critical path aware, timing-driven global placement framework. It leverages graph-based representations to capture global net interactions and employs a nonlinear model to integrate diverse timing-related features for precise delay prediction, thereby improving the overall placement quality for FPGAs. TD-Placer adopts a quadratic placement objective that minimizes wirelength while incorporating a timing term constructed by a lightweight algorithm, enabling efficient and high-quality timing optimization. Regarding net-level timing contention, it also employs a finer-grained weighting scheme to facilitate smooth reduction of the Critical Path Delay (CPD). Extensive experiments were carried out on seven real-world open-source FPGA projects with LUT counts ranging from 60K to 400K. The results demonstrate that TD-Placer achieves an average 10% improvement in Worst Negative Slack (WNS) and a 5% reduction in CPD compared to the state-of-the-art method, with an average CPD comparable (*1.01) to the commercial AMD Vivado across five versions (2020.2-2024.2).

This AL component intelligently learns PVT-timing correlations, actively guiding the expensive simulations to the most informative corners, thus minimizing redundancy in multicorner characterization.

B-splines prove particularly challenging to accelerate due to their recursive definition. Systolic Array (SA)based architectures have shown great promise as DNN accelerators thanks to their energy efficiency and low latency. However, their suitability and efficiency in accelerating KANs have never been assessed. Thus, in this work, we explore the use of SA architecture to accelerate the KAN inference.

Because it occupies over half of the chip area, cache memory is highly susceptible to transient and permanent faults, posing reliability challenges. As the only hardware-managed memory module, the cache tag array is the most active and critical component, dominating both energy usage and error rate. Tag partitioning is a widely used technique to reduce tag-access energy and enhance reliability. It divides tag comparison into two phases: first comparing the k lower bits, and then activating only the matching tag entries to compare the remaining higher bits. The key design parameter is the selection of the tag-splitting point k, which determines how many reads are eliminated. However, prior studies have chosen k intuitively, randomly, or empirically, without justification. Even experimentally determined values are ad-hoc and do not generalize across cache configurations due to high sensitivity to architectural parameters.\n  In this paper, we analytically show that choosing k too large or too small substantially reduces the effectiveness of tag partitioning. We then derive a formulation that determines the optimal splitting point based on cache configuration parameters. The formulation is convex, differentiable, and capable of precisely quantifying tag-partitioning efficiency for any k and configuration. To validate our model, we experimentally evaluate tag-partitioning efficiency and optimal k across a broad set of cache designs and demonstrate close agreement between analytical and experimental results. The proposed formulation enables designers and researchers to instantly compute the optimal tag-splitting point and accurately estimate tag-read reduction."}

In this tutorial paper, we outline the main architectural design principles behind fully digital neuromorphic processors and illustrate them using the SENECA platform as a running example. Starting from a flexible array of tiny RISC-V processing cores connected by a simple Network-on-Chip (NoC), we show how to progressively evolve the architecture: from a baseline event-driven implementation of fully connected networks, to versions with dedicated Neural Processing Elements (NPEs) and a loop controller that offloads fine-grained control from the general-purpose cores. Along the way, we discuss software and mapping techniques such as spike grouping, event-driven depth-first convolution for convolutional networks, and hard-attention style processing for high-resolution event-based vision. The focus is on architectural trade-offs, performance and energy bottlenecks, and on leveraging flexibility to incrementally add domain-specific acceleration. This paper assumes familiarity with basic neuromorphic concepts (spikes, event-driven computation, sparse activation) and deep neural network workloads. It does not present new experimental results; instead, it synthesizes and contextualizes findings previously reported in our SENECA publications to provide a coherent, step-by-step architectural perspective for students and practitioners who wish to design their own digital neuromorphic processors."}

However, fixed-point numbers cover a relatively small dynamic range for a given bitwidth. In contrast, floating-point numbers offer a larger dynamic range at the cost of increased hardware complexity. In this paper, we propose a novel number format called variable-point (VP). VP numbers cover a larger dynamic range than fixed-point numbers with similar bitwidth, without notably increasing hardware complexity -- this allows for a more efficient representation of signals with high dynamic range. To demonstrate the efficacy of the proposed VP number format, we consider a matrix-vector multiplication engine for spatial equalization in multi-antenna wireless communication systems involving high-dynamic-range signals. Through post-layout VLSI implementation results, we demonstrate that the proposed VP-based design achieves 20% and 10% area and power savings, respectively, compared to a fully optimized fixed-point design, without incurring any noticeable performance degradation."}

To address this challenge, we focus on Coarse-Grained Reconfigurable Arrays (CGRAs) as an effective alternative that provides a trade-off between energy efficiency and programmability. This paper presents the first comprehensive, end-to-end evaluation of a non-AI-specialized Coarse-Grained Linear Array (CGLA) accelerator for the state-of-the-art Qwen LLM family. The architecture has a general-purpose, task-agnostic design, yet its flexible instruction set allows for domain-specific adaptations. This flexibility enables the architecture to achieve high efficiency for sustainable LLM inference. We assess the performance of our architecture on an FPGA prototype using the widely adopted llama.cpp framework. We then project its potential as a 28nm ASIC and compare it against a high-performance GPU (NVIDIA RTX 4090) and an edge AI device (NVIDIA Jetson AGX Orin). While GPUs exhibit lower latency, our non-AI-specific accelerator achieves higher energy efficiency, improving the Power-Delay Product (PDP) by up to 44.4x and 13.6x compared with the RTX 4090 and Jetson, respectively. Similarly, it reduces the Energy-Delay Product (EDP) by up to 11.5x compared to the high-performance GPU, demonstrating a favorable performance-energy trade-off. Critically, our system-level analysis identifies host-accelerator data transfer as the primary performance bottleneck, a factor often overlooked in kernel-level studies. These findings provide design guidance for next-generation LLM accelerators. This work validates CGRAs as a suitable platform for LLM inference in power-constrained environments, without being confined to specific algorithms."}

Dynamic binary translation (DBT) is the main solution but suffers from poor performance. Cross-compilation avoids emulation costs but is constrained by an \"all-or-nothing\" model-programs are either fully cross-compiled or entirely emulated. Complete cross-compilation is often unfeasible due to ISA-specific code or missing dependencies, leaving programs with high emulation overhead.\n  We propose a hybrid execution system that combines compilation and emulation, featuring a selective function offloading mechanism. This mechanism establishes cross-environment calling channels, offloading eligible functions to the host for native execution to reduce DBT overhead. Key optimizations address offloading costs, enabling efficient hybrid operation. Built on LLVM and QEMU, the system works automatically for both applications and libraries. Evaluations show it achieves up to 13x speedups over existing DBT, with strong practical value."}

This paper details the design, implementation, and evaluation of a 32-bit dual-stack microprocessor architecture optimized for low-cost, resource-constrained Field-Programmable Gate Arrays (FPGAs). Implemented on the Gowin GW1NR-9 (Tang Nano 9K), the processor utilizes an instruction set architecture (ISA) inspired from a subset of the WebAssembly (WASM) specification to achieve high code density. Unlike traditional soft-cores that often rely on proprietary vendor toolchains and opaque IP blocks, this design is synthesized and routed utilizing an open-source flow, providing transparency and portability. The architecture features a dual-stack model (Data and Return), executing directly from SPI Flash via an Execute-in-Place (XIP) mechanism to conserve scarce Block RAM on the intended target device. An analysis of the trade-offs involved in stack depth parametrization is presented, demonstrating that an 8-entry distributed RAM implementation provides a balance between logic resource utilization ($\\sim 80\\%$) and routing congestion. Furthermore, timing hazards in single-cycle stack operations are identified and resolved through a refined Finite State Machine (FSM) design.

Preserving this fine granularity necessitated the introduction of bank groups and pseudo channels. These structures expand timing parameters and control overhead, significantly increasing memory controller scheduling complexity. Large language models (LLMs) now dominate deep learning workloads, streaming contiguous data blocks ranging from several kilobytes to megabytes per operation. In a conventional HBM-based memory system, these transfers are fragmented into hundreds of 32B cache line transactions. This forces the memory controller to employ unnecessarily intricate scheduling, leading to growing inefficiency.\n  To address this problem, we propose RoMe. RoMe accesses DRAM at row granularity and removes columns, bank groups, and pseudo channels from the memory interface. This design simplifies memory scheduling, thereby requiring fewer pins per channel. The freed pins are aggregated to form additional channels, increasing overall bandwidth by 12.5% with minimal extra pins. RoMe demonstrates how memory scheduling logic can be significantly simplified for representative LLM workloads, and presents an alternative approach for next-generation HBM-based memory systems achieving increased bandwidth with minimal hardware overhead."}
