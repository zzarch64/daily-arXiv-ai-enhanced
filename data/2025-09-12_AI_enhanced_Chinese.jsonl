These\nagentic LLM inference tasks are fundamentally different from chatbot-focused\ninference -- they often have much larger context lengths to capture complex,\nprolonged inputs, such as entire webpage DOMs or complicated tool call\ntrajectories. This, in turn, generates significant off-chip memory traffic for\nthe underlying hardware at the inference stage and causes the workload to be\nconstrained by two memory walls, namely the bandwidth and capacity memory\nwalls, preventing the on-chip compute units from achieving high utilization.\n  In this paper, we introduce PLENA, a hardware-software co-designed system\nthat applies three core optimization pathways to tackle these challenges. PLENA\nincludes an efficient hardware implementation of compute and memory units\nsupporting an asymmetric quantization scheme. PLENA also features a novel\nflattened systolic array architecture that has native support for\nFlashAttention to tackle these memory walls in the scenario of inference\nserving for long-context LLMs. Additionally, PLENA is developed with a complete\nstack, including a custom ISA, a compiler, a cycle-emulated simulator, and an\nautomated design space exploration flow. The simulated results show that PLENA\nachieves up to 8.5x higher utilization than existing accelerators, and delivers\n2.24x higher throughput than the A100 GPU and 3.85x higher throughput than the\nTPU v6e, under the same multiplier count and memory settings.
