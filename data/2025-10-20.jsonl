In this paper, we\ndemonstrate that the Ramulator 2.0 simulation results reported in the Mess\npaper are incorrect and, at the time of the publication of the Mess paper,\nirreproducible. We find that the authors of Mess paper made multiple trivial\nhuman errors in both the configuration and usage of the simulators. We show\nthat by correctly configuring Ramulator 2.0, Ramulator 2.0's simulated memory\nsystem performance actually resembles real system characteristics well, and\nthus a key claimed contribution of the Mess paper is factually incorrect. We\nalso identify that the DAMOV simulation results in the Mess paper use wrong\nsimulation statistics that are unrelated to the simulated DRAM performance.\nMoreover, the Mess paper's artifact repository lacks the necessary sources to\nfully reproduce all the Mess paper's results.\n  Our work corrects the Mess paper's errors regarding Ramulator 2.0 and\nidentifies important issues in the Mess paper's memory simulator evaluation\nmethodology. We emphasize the importance of both carefully and rigorously\nvalidating simulation results and contacting simulator authors and developers,\nin true open source spirit, to ensure these simulators are used with correct\nconfigurations and as intended. We encourage the computer architecture\ncommunity to correct the Mess paper's errors. This is necessary to prevent the\npropagation of inaccurate and misleading results, and to maintain the\nreliability of the scientific record. Our investigation also opens up questions\nabout the integrity of the review and artifact evaluation processes.
