Quantized LLMs offer significant advantages with extremely quantized models, motivating the development of specialized architectures to accelerate their workloads. This paper proposes D-Legion, a novel scalable many-core architecture, designed using many adaptive-precision systolic array cores, to accelerate matrix multiplication in quantized LLMs. The proposed architecture consists of a set of Legions where each Legion has a group of adaptive-precision systolic arrays. D-Legion supports multiple computation modes, including quantized sparse and dense matrix multiplications. The block structured sparsity is exploited within a fully-sparse, or partially-sparse windows. In addition, memory accesses of partial summations (psums) are spatially reduced through parallel accumulators. Furthermore, data reuse is maximized through optimized scheduling techniques by multicasting matrix tiles across the Legions. A comprehensive design space exploration is performed in terms of Legion/core granularity to determine the optimal Legion configuration. Moreover, D-Legion is evaluated on attention workloads from two BitNet models, delivering up to 8.2$\\times$ lower latency, up to 3.8$\\times$ higher memory savings, and up to 3$\\times$ higher psum memory savings compared to state-of-the-art work. D-Legion, with eight Legions and 64 total cores, achieves a peak throughput of 135,68 TOPS at a frequency of 1 GHz. A scaled version of D-Legion, with 32 Legions, is compared to Google TPUv4i, achieving up to 2.5$\\times$ lower total latency, up to 2.3$\\times$ higher total throughput, and up to 2.7$\\times$ higher total memory savings."}
