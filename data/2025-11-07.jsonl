Subsequent revisits to the rule largely\nretained that economics-only view, leaving host costs, feasibility limits, and\nworkload behavior out of scope. This paper revisits the rule from first\nprinciples, integrating host costs, DRAM bandwidth/capacity, and\nphysics-grounded models of SSD performance and cost, and then embedding these\nelements in a constraint- and workload-aware framework that yields actionable\nprovisioning guidance. We show that, for modern AI platforms, especially\nGPU-centric hosts paired with ultra-high-IOPS SSDs engineered for fine-grained\nrandom access, the DRAM-to-flash caching threshold collapses from minutes to a\nfew seconds. This shift reframes NAND flash memory as an active data tier and\nexposes a broad research space across the hardware-software stack. We further\nintroduce MQSim-Next, a calibrated SSD simulator that supports validation and\nsensitivity analysis and facilitates future architectural and system research.\nFinally, we present two concrete case studies that showcase the software system\ndesign space opened by such memory hierarchy paradigm shift. Overall, we turn a\nclassical heuristic into an actionable, feasibility-aware analysis and\nprovisioning framework and set the stage for further research on AI-era memory\nhierarchy."}

However, the pursuit of higher\nperformance necessitates more complex circuit designs and increased operating\nfrequencies, which exacerbate IR-drop issues. Severe IR-drop can significantly\ndegrade chip performance and even threaten reliability. Conventional\ncircuit-level IR-drop mitigation methods, such as back-end optimizations, are\nresource-intensive and often compromise power, performance, and area (PPA). To\naddress these challenges, we propose AIM, comprehensive software and hardware\nco-design for architecture-level IR-drop mitigation in high-performance PIM.\nInitially, leveraging the bit-serial and in-situ dataflow processing properties\nof PIM, we introduce Rtog and HR, which establish a direct correlation between\nPIM workloads and IR-drop. Building on this foundation, we propose LHR and WDS,\nenabling extensive exploration of architecture-level IR-drop mitigation while\nmaintaining computational accuracy through software optimization. Subsequently,\nwe develop IR-Booster, a dynamic adjustment mechanism that integrates\nsoftware-level HR information with hardware-based IR-drop monitoring to adapt\nthe V-f pairs of the PIM macro, achieving enhanced energy efficiency and\nperformance. Finally, we propose the HR-aware task mapping method, bridging\nsoftware and hardware designs to achieve optimal improvement. Post-layout\nsimulation results on a 7nm 256-TOPS PIM chip demonstrate that AIM achieves up\nto 69.2% IR-drop mitigation, resulting in 2.29x energy efficiency improvement\nand 1.152x speedup."}
