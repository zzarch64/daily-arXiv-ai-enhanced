Such data, encompassing the types of kernels executed and the time\nspent in each, is crucial for optimizing chip design and enhancing application\nperformance. Unfortunately, despite the availability of low-level tools like\nNSYS and NCU, current methodologies fall short, offering data collection\ncapabilities only on an individual user basis rather than a broader, more\ninformative fleet-wide scale. This paper takes on the problem of realizing a\nsystem that allows planet-scale real-time GPU performance profiling of\nlow-level hardware characteristics. The three fundamental problems we solve\nare: i) user experience of achieving this with no slowdown; ii) preserving user\nprivacy, so that no 3rd party is aware of what applications any user runs; iii)\nefficacy in showing we are able to collect data and assign it applications even\nwhen run on 1000s of GPUs. Our results simulate a 100,000 size GPU deployment,\nrunning applications from the Torchbench suite, showing our system addresses\nall 3 problems."}

This\npaper introduces a novel deep learning framework for high-fidelity,\n``in-the-wild'' simulation on production hardware. Our core contribution is a\nDL model trained on microarchitecture-independent features to predict\ncycle-level performance for hypothetical processor designs. This unique\napproach allows the model to be deployed on existing silicon to evaluate future\nhardware. We propose a complete system featuring a lightweight hardware trace\ncollector and a principled sampling strategy to minimize user impact. This\nsystem achieves a simulation speed of 5 MIPS on a commodity GPU, imposing a\nmere 0.1% performance overhead. Furthermore, our co-designed Neutrino on-chip\naccelerator improves performance by 85x over the GPU. We demonstrate that this\nframework enables accurate performance analysis and large-scale hardware A/B\ntesting on a massive scale using real-world applications."}

While\nquantization has been widely explored to reduce model size and computation,\nthis paper demonstrates an additional benefit: quantization increases parameter\nlocality, creating opportunities for computation reuse. Building on this\ninsight, we propose AxLLM, a hardware accelerator architecture designed for\nquantized models. Axllm introduces a novel redundancy elimination technique\nthat caches and reuses multiplication results for repeated weight values,\nsubstantially reducing redundant operations. The architecture features dual\nmultiply and reuse pipelines, efficiently supporting both base models and LoRA\nfine-tuned models without altering parameters, retraining, or requiring offline\npreprocessing. Experimental results show that AxLLM achieves up to 90%\nreduction in computations, delivering 28% lower energy consumption and a 1.7x\nspeedup over baseline execution. These results highlight Axllm as a scalable\nand efficient solution for accelerating LLMs on specialized hardware."}
