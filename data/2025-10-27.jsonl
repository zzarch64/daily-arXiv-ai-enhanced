FIFO sizes are user-defined and balance\nlatency and area-undersized FIFOs cause stalls and potential deadlocks, while\noversized ones waste memory. Determining optimal sizes is non-trivial: existing\nmethods rely on restrictive assumptions, conservative over-allocation, or slow\nRTL simulations. We emphasize that runtime-based analyses (i.e., simulation)\nare the only reliable way to ensure deadlock-free FIFO optimization for\ndata-dependent designs.\n  We present FIFOAdvisor, a framework that automatically determines FIFO sizes\nin HLS designs. It leverages LightningSim, a 99.9\\% cycle-accurate simulator\nsupporting millisecond-scale incremental runs with new FIFO configurations.\nFIFO sizing is formulated as a dual-objective black-box optimization problem,\nand we explore heuristic and search-based methods to characterize the\nlatency-resource trade-off. FIFOAdvisor also integrates with Stream-HLS, a\nframework for optimizing affine dataflow designs lowered from C++, MLIR, or\nPyTorch, enabling deeper optimization of FIFOs in these workloads.\n  We evaluate FIFOAdvisor on Stream-HLS design benchmarks spanning linear\nalgebra and deep learning workloads. Our results reveal Pareto-optimal\nlatency-memory frontiers across optimization strategies. Compared to baseline\ndesigns, FIFOAdvisor achieves much lower memory usage with minimal delay\noverhead. Additionally, it delivers significant runtime speedups over\ntraditional HLS/RTL co-simulation, making it practical for rapid design space\nexploration. We further demonstrate its capability on a complex accelerator\nwith data-dependent control flow.\n  Code and results: https://github.com/sharc-lab/fifo-advisor"}

This paper\nproposes a hardwareefficientaccurate 4-bit multiplier design for AMD Xilinx\n7-series FPGAs using only 11 LUTs and two CARRY4 blocks. By reorganizing the\nlogic functions mapped to the LUTs, the proposed method reduces the LUT count\nby one compared with the prior 12-LUT design while also shortening the critical\npath.
