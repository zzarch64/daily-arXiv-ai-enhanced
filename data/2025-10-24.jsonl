The design of approximate adders has\nbeen widely researched to advance energy-efficient hardware for computation\nintensive multimedia applications, such as image/audio/video processing.\nSeveral static and dynamic approximate adders exist in the literature, each of\nwhich endeavors to balance the conflicting demands of high performance,\ncomputational accuracy, and energy efficiency. This work introduces a novel\napproximate adder that is more energy- and area-efficient than existing adders,\nwhile achieving improved or comparable accuracy, as demonstrated by simulation\nresults. The proposed adder's ability to digitally reconstruct high quality\nimages is further demonstrated by the deployment of the design for an image\nprocessing task."}

We\nrigorously analyze SiMRA's true random generation potential in terms of\nentropy, latency, and throughput for varying numbers of simultaneously\nactivated DRAM rows (i.e., 2, 4, 8, 16, and 32), data patterns, temperature\nlevels, and spatial variations. Among our 11 key experimental observations, we\nhighlight four key results. First, we evaluate the quality of our TRNG designs\nusing the commonly-used NIST statistical test suite for randomness and find\nthat all SiMRA-based TRNG designs successfully pass each test. Second, 2-, 8-,\n16-, and 32-row activation-based TRNG designs outperform the state-of-theart\nDRAM-based TRNG in throughput by up to 1.15x, 1.99x, 1.82x, and 1.39x,\nrespectively. Third, SiMRA's entropy tends to increase with the number of\nsimultaneously activated DRAM rows. Fourth, operational parameters and\nconditions (e.g., data pattern and temperature) significantly affect entropy.\nFor example, for most of the tested modules, the average entropy of 32-row\nactivation is 2.51x higher than that of 2-row activation. For example,\nincreasing the temperature from 50{\\deg}C to 90{\\deg}C decreases SiMRA's\nentropy by 1.53x for 32-row activation. To aid future research and development,\nwe open-source our infrastructure at https://github.com/CMU-SAFARI/SiMRA-TRNG."}

Traditional\ngeneral-purpose accelerators struggle to effectively exploit fine-grain\nparallelism due to limitations in implementing convoluted data-dependency\npatterns (like SIMD) and overheads due to synchronization and data transfers\n(like GPGPUs). In contrast, custom FPGA and ASIC designs offer improved\nperformance and energy efficiency at a high cost in hardware design and\nprogramming complexity and often lack the flexibility to process different\nworkloads. We propose Squire, a general-purpose accelerator designed to exploit\nfine-grain parallelism effectively on dependency-bound kernels. Each Squire\naccelerator has a set of general-purpose low-power in-order cores that can\nrapidly communicate among themselves and directly access data from the L2\ncache. Our proposal integrates one Squire accelerator per core in a typical\nmulticore system, allowing the acceleration of dependency-bound kernels within\nparallel tasks with minimal software changes. As a case study, we evaluate\nSquire's effectiveness by accelerating five kernels that implement complex\ndependency patterns. We use three of these kernels to build an end-to-end\nread-mapping tool that will be used to evaluate Squire. Squire obtains speedups\nup to 7.64$\\times$ in dynamic programming kernels. Overall, Squire provides an\nacceleration for an end-to-end application of 3.66$\\times$. In addition, Squire\nreduces energy consumption by up to 56% with a minimal area overhead of 10.5%\ncompared to a Neoverse-N1 baseline."}
