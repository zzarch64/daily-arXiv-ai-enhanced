With the scaling of technology nodes, in floorplanning stage especially 3D scenarios with multiple stacked layers, it has become increasingly challenging to adhere to complex hardware design rules. Current methods are only capable of handling specific and limited design rules, while violations of other rules require manual and meticulous adjustment. This leads to labor-intensive and time-consuming post-processing for expert engineers. In this paper, we propose an all-in-one deep reinforcement learning-based approach to tackle these challenges, and design novel representations for real-world IC design rules that have not been addressed by previous approaches. Specifically, the processing of various hardware design rules is unified into a single framework with three key components: 1) novel matrix representations to model the design rules, 2) constraints on the action space to filter out invalid actions that cause rule violations, and 3) quantitative analysis of constraint satisfaction as reward signals. Experiments on public benchmarks demonstrate the effectiveness and validity of our approach. Furthermore, transferability is well demonstrated on unseen circuits. Our framework is extensible to accommodate new design rules, thus providing flexibility to address emerging challenges in future chip design.

While previous works focused on CPUs, this work extends the concept of heterogeneity to GPUs by proposing KHEPRI, a heterogeneous GPU architecture for graphics applications. Scenes in graphics applications showcase diversity, as they consist of many objects with varying levels of complexity. As a result, computational intensity and memory bandwidth requirements differ significantly across different regions of each scene. To address this variability, our proposal includes two types of cores: cores optimized for high ILP (compute-specialized) and cores that tolerate a higher number of simultaneously outstanding cache misses (memory-specialized). A key component of the proposed architecture is a novel work scheduler that dynamically assigns each part of a frame (i.e., a tile) to the most suitable core. Designing this scheduler is particularly challenging, as it must preserve data locality; otherwise, the benefits of heterogeneity may be offset by the penalty of additional cache misses. Additionally, the scheduler requires knowledge of each tile's characteristics before rendering it. For this purpose, KHEPRI leverages frame-to-frame coherence to predict the behavior of each tile based on that of the corresponding tile in the previous frame. Evaluations across a wide range of commercial animated graphics applications show that, compared to a traditional homogeneous GPU, KHEPRI achieves an average performance improvement of 9.2%, a throughput increase (frames per second) of 7.3%, and a total GPU energy reduction of 4.8%. Importantly, these benefits are achieved without any hardware overhead."}

Traditional heuristic tuning is often inefficient in such high-dimensional, non-smooth landscapes. In this work, we propose a Bayesian Optimization framework using Gaussian Processes to automate the search for optimal scheduling configurations on heterogeneous multi-core architectures. We explicitly address the multi-objective nature of the problem by approximating the Pareto Frontier between energy and time. Furthermore, by incorporating Sensitivity Analysis (fANOVA) and comparing different covariance kernels (e.g., Matérn vs. RBF), we provide physical interpretability to the black-box model, revealing the dominant hardware parameters driving system performance."}

Yet, the multi-physics coupling inherent to stacked architectures manifesting as thermal hot spots, warpage-induced stresses, and interconnect aging demands monitoring and control capabilities that surpass traditional offline metrology. Although Digital Twin (DT) technology provides a principled route to real-time reliability management, the existing literature remains fragmented and frequently blurs the distinction between static multiphysics simulation workflows and truly dynamic, closed-loop twins. This critical review distinguishes itself by addressing these deficiencies through three specific contributions. First, we clarify the Digital Twin hierarchy to resolve terminological ambiguity between digital models, shadows, and twins. Second, we synthesize three foundational enabling technologies: (1) physics-based modeling, emphasizing the shift from computationally intensive finite-element analysis (FEA) to real-time surrogate models; (2) data-driven paradigms, highlighting virtual metrology (VM) for inferring latent metrics; and (3) in-situ sensing, the nervous system coupling the physical stack to its virtual counterpart. Third, beyond a descriptive survey, we propose a unified hybrid DT architecture that leverages physics-informed machine learning (e.g., PINNs) to reconcile data scarcity with latency constraints. Finally, we outline a standards-aligned roadmap incorporating IEEE 1451 and UCIe protocols to accelerate the transition from passive digital shadows to autonomous, self-optimizing Digital Twins for 3D IC manufacturing and field operation."}
