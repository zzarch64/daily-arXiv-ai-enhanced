MoE models use sparse gating to\nactivate only a handful of expert sub-networks per input, achieving\nbillion-parameter capacity with inference costs akin to much smaller models.\nHowever, such models often pose challenges for hardware deployment due to the\nmassive data volume introduced by the MoE layers. To address the challenges of\nserving MoE models, we propose Stratum, a system-hardware co-design approach\nthat combines the novel memory technology Monolithic 3D-Stackable DRAM (Mono3D\nDRAM), near-memory processing (NMP), and GPU acceleration. The logic and Mono3D\nDRAM dies are connected through hybrid bonding, whereas the Mono3D DRAM stack\nand GPU are interconnected via silicon interposer. Mono3D DRAM offers higher\ninternal bandwidth than HBM thanks to the dense vertical interconnect pitch\nenabled by its monolithic structure, which supports implementations of\nhigher-performance near-memory processing. Furthermore, we tackle the latency\ndifferences introduced by aggressive vertical scaling of Mono3D DRAM along the\nz-dimension by constructing internal memory tiers and assigning data across\nlayers based on access likelihood, guided by topic-based expert usage\nprediction to boost NMP throughput. The Stratum system achieves up to 8.29x\nimprovement in decoding throughput and 7.66x better energy efficiency across\nvarious benchmarks compared to GPU baselines.", "AI": {"tldr": "Stratum\u662f\u4e00\u4e2a\u7cfb\u7edf-\u786c\u4ef6\u534f\u540c\u8bbe\u8ba1\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u7ed3\u5408\u4e86\u5355\u72473D\u5806\u53e0DRAM\u3001\u8fd1\u5185\u5b58\u5904\u7406\u548cGPU\u52a0\u901f\uff0c\u4e13\u95e8\u9488\u5bf9MoE\u6a21\u578b\u63a8\u7406\u7684\u786c\u4ef6\u90e8\u7f72\u6311\u6218\uff0c\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e86\u9ad8\u8fbe8.29\u500d\u7684\u89e3\u7801\u541e\u5410\u91cf\u63d0\u5347\u548c7.66\u500d\u7684\u80fd\u6548\u6539\u8fdb\u3002", "motivation": "MoE\u6a21\u578b\u867d\u7136\u901a\u8fc7\u7a00\u758f\u95e8\u63a7\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e86\u4ebf\u7ea7\u53c2\u6570\u5bb9\u91cf\u548c\u8f83\u5c0f\u63a8\u7406\u6210\u672c\uff0c\u4f46\u5176MoE\u5c42\u5f15\u5165\u7684\u5927\u6570\u636e\u91cf\u7ed9\u786c\u4ef6\u90e8\u7f72\u5e26\u6765\u4e86\u6311\u6218\uff0c\u9700\u8981\u89e3\u51b3\u5185\u5b58\u5e26\u5bbd\u548c\u5904\u7406\u6548\u7387\u95ee\u9898\u3002", "method": "\u91c7\u7528\u5355\u72473D\u5806\u53e0DRAM\u63d0\u4f9b\u6bd4HBM\u66f4\u9ad8\u7684\u5185\u90e8\u5e26\u5bbd\uff0c\u7ed3\u5408\u8fd1\u5185\u5b58\u5904\u7406\u548cGPU\u52a0\u901f\uff1b\u901a\u8fc7\u6df7\u5408\u952e\u5408\u8fde\u63a5\u903b\u8f91\u548cDRAM\u82af\u7247\uff0c\u7845\u4e2d\u4ecb\u5c42\u8fde\u63a5DRAM\u5806\u6808\u548cGPU\uff1b\u6784\u5efa\u5185\u90e8\u5185\u5b58\u5c42\u7ea7\u5e76\u6839\u636e\u8bbf\u95ee\u53ef\u80fd\u6027\u5206\u914d\u6570\u636e\uff0c\u5229\u7528\u57fa\u4e8e\u4e3b\u9898\u7684\u4e13\u5bb6\u4f7f\u7528\u9884\u6d4b\u6765\u63d0\u5347NMP\u541e\u5410\u91cf\u3002", "result": "Stratum\u7cfb\u7edf\u5728\u5404\u79cd\u57fa\u51c6\u6d4b\u8bd5\u4e2d\u76f8\u6bd4GPU\u57fa\u7ebf\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e86\u9ad8\u8fbe8.29\u500d\u7684\u89e3\u7801\u541e\u5410\u91cf\u63d0\u5347\u548c7.66\u500d\u7684\u80fd\u6548\u6539\u8fdb\u3002", "conclusion": "Stratum\u901a\u8fc7\u7cfb\u7edf-\u786c\u4ef6\u534f\u540c\u8bbe\u8ba1\u6210\u529f\u89e3\u51b3\u4e86MoE\u6a21\u578b\u90e8\u7f72\u4e2d\u7684\u5185\u5b58\u5e26\u5bbd\u548c\u5904\u7406\u6548\u7387\u74f6\u9888\uff0c\u4e3a\u5927\u89c4\u6a21MoE\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u786c\u4ef6\u52a0\u901f\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u6709\u6548\u89e3\u51b3\u65b9\u6848\u3002"}}

Additionally, as general-purpose LLMs continue to improve,\nfine-tuned methods on older models will not be able to compete to produce more\naccurate and efficient designs.
