Motivation: 条件分支预测是模式识别问题，准确预测能减少错误路径指令执行，提高性能和降低能耗。需要更好的工作负载表征方法来理解分支预测器的性能差异。

Method: 提出分支工作集大小和分支可预测性两个新指标。分支工作集定义为最常出现的分支上下文（分支地址、全局历史、局部历史的三元组）。分析2451个工作负载轨迹，将其分类为7个工作集大小和9个可预测性类别。

Result: 这两个参数与现代分支预测方案（如TAGE和感知器）的误预测率高度相关。通过分析揭示了预测准确性的来源和现代分支预测器偏好的工作负载类别。

Conclusion: 提出的工作负载表征方法能有效评估分支预测器性能，为理解分支预测准确性提供了新视角，有助于优化预测器设计和选择适合的工作负载。

Abstract: Conditional branch prediction predicts the likely direction of a conditional branch instruction to support ILP extraction. Branch prediction is a pattern recognition problem that learns mappings between a context to the branch outcome. An accurate predictor reduces the number of instructions executed on the wrong path resulting in an improvement of performance and energy consumption. In this paper, we present a workload characterization methodology for branch prediction. We propose two new workload-driven branch prediction accuracy identifiers -- branch working set size and branch predictability. These parameters are highly correlated with misprediction rates of modern branch prediction schemes (e.g. TAGE and perceptron). We define the branch working set of a trace as a group of most frequently occurring branch contexts, i.e. the 3-part tuple of branch address, and associated global and local history. We analyze the branch working set's size and predictability on a per-trace basis to study its relationship with a modern branch predictor's accuracy. We have characterized 2,451 workload traces into seven branch working set size and nine predictability categories after analyzing their branch behavior. We present further insights into the source of prediction accuracy and favored workload categories for modern branch predictors.

Motivation: 下一代人机交互需要始终在线、空间感知的可穿戴设备来捕捉自我中心视觉和功能原语，以构建用户的个人上下文。然而，设计支持上下文AI的可穿戴系统面临系统复杂性和严格功耗约束的挑战。

Method: 提出了Aria2可穿戴上下文AI系统的完整系统架构视图，通过系统建模和设计空间探索过程，展示了端到端全系统模型的重要性。

Result: 研究表明，在这种系统中没有单一组件或类别完全主导系统功耗，因此需要在全系统上下文中进行长期设计决策和功耗优化，以避免因其他系统瓶颈而受限。

Conclusion: 端到端全系统视图对于可穿戴上下文AI系统设计至关重要，需要整体优化方法以避免瓶颈转移，这些见解对于最终实现全天候可穿戴上下文AI系统具有重要意义。

Abstract: The next generation of human-oriented computing will require always-on, spatially-aware wearable devices to capture egocentric vision and functional primitives (e.g., Where am I? What am I looking at?, etc.). These devices will sense an egocentric view of the world around us to observe all human- relevant signals across space and time to construct and maintain a user's personal context. This personal context, combined with advanced generative AI, will unlock a powerful new generation of contextual AI personal assistants and applications. However, designing a wearable system to support contextual AI is a daunting task because of the system's complexity and stringent power constraints due to weight and battery restrictions. To understand how to guide design for such systems, this work provides the first complete system architecture view of one such wearable contextual AI system (Aria2), along with the lessons we have learned through the system modeling and design space exploration process. We show that an end-to-end full system model view of such systems is vitally important, as no single component or category overwhelmingly dominates system power. This means long-range design decisions and power optimizations need to be made in the full system context to avoid running into limits caused by other system bottlenecks (i.e., Amdahl's law as applied to power) or as bottlenecks change. Finally, we reflect on lessons and insights for the road ahead, which will be important toward eventually enabling all-day, wearable, contextual AI systems.
