Motivation: RISC-V ISA作为免费开源替代方案，需要一个易于使用且稳健的实现来适应教学和业余使用需求。

Method: 首先提出教学视角的评估标准，然后分析现有开源RISC-V实现，最后开发满足所有标准的可组合框架。

Result: 开发了一个全面的开源解决方案，其组件可以根据课程需求进行分解使用，并收集了学生反馈。

Conclusion: 成功创建了一个满足教学需求的RISC-V实现框架，为其他教育工作者提供了可用的开源资源。

Abstract: While most instruction set architectures (ISAs) are only available to use
through the purchase of a restrictive commercial license, the RISC-V ISA
presents a free and open-source alternative. Due to this availability, many
free and open-source implementations have been developed and can be accessed on
platforms such as GitHub. If an open source, easy-to-use, and robust RISC-V
implementation could be obtained, it could be easily adapted for pedagogical
and amateur use. In this work we accomplish three goals in relation to this
outlook. First, we propose a set of criteria for evaluating the components of a
RISC-V implementation's ecosystem from a pedagogical perspective. Second, we
analyze a number of existing open-source RISC-V implementations to determine
how many of the criteria they fulfill. We then develop a comprehensive solution
that meets all of these criterion and is released open-source for other
instructors to use. The framework is developed in a composable way that it's
different components can be disaggregated per individual course needs. Finally,
we also report on a limited study of student feedback.

Motivation: 随着处理器复杂度增加，功能验证和性能验证的成本急剧增长。传统方法如性能计数器和微架构模拟存在运行时间长、不准确或成本高的问题。

Method: 采用Scale-Down方法，将系统分解为可管理的子组件进行独立原型设计，通过精心设计的原型接口确保被测设备的严格非干扰性，实现周期精确的协同仿真。

Result: 开发了ZynqParrot平台，能够执行非干扰、周期精确的RTL设计协同仿真，验证功能和性能，并通过开源RISC-V处理器的案例研究展示了其有效性。

Conclusion: Scale-Down方法结合FPGA加速，在保持速度的同时消除了Scale-Out的不准确性和Scale-Up的高成本，为架构师提供了两全其美的解决方案。

Abstract: As processors increase in complexity, costs grow even more rapidly, both for
functional verification and performance validation. Most often, silicon
characterizations comprise simple performance counters, which are aggregated
and separated to tell a story. Based on these inferences, performance engineers
employ microarchitectural simulation to inspect deeply into the core.
Unfortunately, dramatically longer runtimes make simulation infeasible for long
workloads.
  We propose a Scale-Down approach to modelling and validation. Rather than
up-sizing a prototyping platform to fit large and complex system designs, we
show that it can be more accurate, faster, and more economical to decompose a
system into manageable sub-components that can be prototyped independently. By
carefully designing the prototyping interface, it is possible to adhere to
strict non-interference of the Device Under Test (DUT). This allows architects
to have the best of both worlds: the speed of FPGA acceleration while
eliminating the inaccuracies of Scale-Out and the inherent costs of Scale-Up.
  In this work, we present ZynqParrot: a Scale-Down FPGA-based modelling
platform, capable of executing non-interfering, cycle-accurate co-emulations of
arbitrary RTL designs. ZynqParrot is capable of verifying functionality and
performance with arbitrary granularity. We also provide case studies using
ZynqParrot to analyze the full-stack performance of an open-source RISC-V
processor.
