While\nsparsity can reduce these costs, existing design space exploration (DSE)\nframeworks often overlook compression formats, a key factor for leveraging\nsparsity on accelerators. This paper proposes SnipSnap, a joint compression\nformat and dataflow co-optimization framework for efficient sparse LLM\naccelerator design. SnipSnap introduces: (1) a hierarchical compression format\nencoding to expand the design space; (2) an adaptive compression engine for\nselecting formats under diverse sparsity; and (3) a progressive co-search\nworkflow that jointly optimizes dataflow and compression formats. SnipSnap\nachieves 18.24\\% average memory energy savings via format optimization, along\nwith 2248.3$\\times$ and 21.0$\\times$ speedups over Sparseloop and DiMO-Sparse\nframeworks, respectively."}

However, despite these advantages, the use of bamboo in its natural\nform for structural applications remains limited, partly due to insufficient\nknowledge of connection behavior, which is crucial for ensuring the long-term\nreliability and performance of bamboo structures. This article provides a\ncomprehensive review of the key factors to consider in the design of structural\nbamboo connections and discusses the existing connection classification methods\nused as guidelines by designers. By synthesizing findings from the literature,\nour research aims to identify the key parameters interacting with the\nconnection design process, focusing on the anatomical, geometric, and\nmechanical properties of bamboo, the mechanical requirements of the structure\ndesign, and the building methods. A critical analysis of Janssen's\nclassification of bamboo connections, based on force transfer modes and later\nrefined by Widyowijatnoko, is presented. Finally, we discuss the identified\nresearch gaps and emphasize the need for integrated design approaches supported\nby guidelines to support the broader adoption of bamboo in construction."}

Nandha Kumar", "Haider Abbas F.

We hypothesize\nthat to design circuits capable of bursting, the neuron circuit design must\nmimic a neuron model that inherently exhibits bursting dynamics. Consequently,\nclassical models such as the Hodgkin-Huxley, $I_{Na,p}+I_{K}$, and\nFitzHugh-Nagumo models are not suitable choices. Instead, we propose a\nmethodology for designing neuron circuits that emulate the qualitative\ncharacteristics of the $I_{Na,p}+I_{K}+I_{K(M)}$ model, a well-established\nminimal bursting neuron model. Based on this methodology, we present two novel\nMOSFET-based circuits that exhibit bursting. Using the method of dissection of\nneural bursting, we demonstrate that the nullcline and bifurcation diagrams of\nthe fast subsystem in our circuits are qualitatively equivalent to those of the\n$I_{Na,p}+I_{K}+I_{K(M)}$ model. Furthermore, we examine the effect of the type\nof bifurcation at burst initiation and termination on the bursting\ncharacteristics, showing that our circuits can exhibit diverse bursting\nbehaviours. Importantly, the main contribution of this work lies not in the\nspecific circuit implementation, but in the methodology proposed for\nconstructing bursting neuron circuits."}
