The key technical feature of\nHYLU is the integration of hybrid numerical kernels so that it can adapt to\nvarious sparsity patterns of coefficient matrices. Tests on 34 sparse matrices\nfrom SuiteSparse Matrix Collection reveal that HYLU outperforms Intel MKL\nPARDISO in the numerical factorization phase by geometric means of 1.74X (for\none-time solving) and 2.26X (for repeated solving). HYLU can be downloaded from\nhttps://github.com/chenxm1986/hylu."}
