However, existing bit-truncation memories require custom designs for a specific application. In this paper, we present a novel bit-truncation memory with full adaptation flexibility, which can truncate any number of data bits at run time to meet different quality and power trade-off requirements for various approximate applications. The developed bit-truncation memory has been applied to two representative data-intensive approximate applications: video processing and deep learning. Our experiments show that the proposed memory can support three different video applications (including luminance-aware, content-aware, and region-of-interest-aware) with enhanced power efficiency (up to 47.02% power savings) as compared to state-of-the-art. In addition, the proposed memory achieves significant (up to 51.69%) power savings for both baseline and pruned lightweight deep learning models, respectively, with a low implementation cost (2.89% silicon area overhead)."}

Uneven wear of memory is a major barrier. The problem is becoming even more urgent as emerging memory such as phase-change memory is subject to even shorter lifespan. Various solutions have been proposed, but they either require complicated hardware extensions or apply only to certain program constructs such as loops. This research proposes a new method, dual-ring wear leveling. It takes inspiration from the natural law known as the ``golden ratio\" and how it helps flower petals evenly receive sun lights. By modeling memory as two rings and combines the idea with existing memory management, garbage collection, the new solution offers an effective way to reduce memory wear and hence lengthen memory lifespan. It is deterministic, able to automatically adapt to memory size, requiring no hardware changes, and adding no slowdown to program executions."}

This is way more promising for scalability and integration density than the default option of improving the fidelity of the analog neural network at the cost of significant energy, area, and design overhead, through extensive calibration and conservative analog design.\n  We first present a physics-informed hardware-aware model for a time-domain vector-matrix multiplier implemented with single-transistor floating-gate memory cells that explicitly accounts for two dominant non-idealities of the physical implementation - capacitive crosstalk and bit-line voltage drop - and integrates seamlessly with modern deep-learning workflows. The model discretizes each operation into adaptive time slots, processes activation patterns in parallel, and accumulates their contributions to predict effective multiplier outputs. Using measurements from a 16x16 silicon array, we calibrate the model, show that crosstalk is layout-dependent and often dominant, and introduce an improved weight-extraction procedure that doubles signal-to-error ratio versus an ideal vector-matrix multiplier model. Finally, we show that by training silicon-based analog neural networks using an hardware-aware model in the forward pass we can recover the accuracy of the ideal software networks across three architectures -- custom MLP on low-resolution MNIST, LeNet-5 on MNIST, and a VGG-style CNN on CIFAR-10 - establishing a complete design-to-deployment workflow for time-domain analog neuromorphic chips."}

These challenges become particularly acute in the context of multimodal LLMs (MLLMs), as high-dimensional visual inputs are transformed into extensive token sequences, thereby inflating the key-value (KV) cache and imposing substantial data movement overheads to the LLM backbone. To address these issues, we present CHIME, a chiplet-based heterogeneous near-memory acceleration for edge MLLMs inference. CHIME leverages the complementary strengths of integrated monolithic 3D (M3D) DRAM and RRAM chiplets: DRAM supplies low-latency bandwidth for attention, while RRAM offers dense, non-volatile storage for weights. This heterogeneous hardware is orchestrated by a co-designed mapping framework that executes fused kernels near data, minimizing cross-chiplet traffic to maximize effective bandwidth. On FastVLM (0.6B/1.7B) and MobileVLM (1.7B/3B), CHIME achieves up to 54x speedup and up to 246x better energy efficiency per inference as compared to the edge GPU NVIDIA Jetson Orin NX. It sustains 116.5-266.5 token/J compared to Jetson's 0.7-1.1 token/J. Furthermore, it delivers up to 69.2x higher throughput than the state-of-the-art PIM accelerator FACIL.

In contrast, systematic analysis of modern large-scale LLMs remains limited, despite their rapid adoption in diverse application scenarios. Given the unique characteristics of LLMs, their resilience to soft errors may differ substantially from earlier models. To bridge this gap, we conduct the first instruction-level fault injection study of LLM inference. Our approach reveals reliability characteristics from multiple perspectives, highlighting the effects of model architecture, parameter scale, and task complexity.

However, the high dimensionality, sparsity, and repeated data movement involved in HDC make these computations difficult to accelerate efficiently on conventional processors. As a result, executing core HDC operations: binding, permutation, bundling, and similarity search: on CPUs or GPUs often leads to suboptimal utilization, memory bottlenecks, and limits on real-time performance. In this paper, our contributions are two-fold. First, we develop an image-encoding algorithm that, similar in spirit to convolutional neural networks, maps local image patches to hypervectors enriched with spatial information. These patch-level hypervectors are then merged into a global representation using the fundamental HDC operations, enabling spatially sensitive and robust image encoding. This encoder achieves 95.67% accuracy on MNIST and 85.14% on Fashion-MNIST, outperforming prior HDC-based image encoders. Second, we design an end-to-end accelerator that implements these compute operations on an FPGA through a pipelined architecture that exploits parallelism both across the hypervector dimensionality and across the set of image patches.

However, if the complexity can be reduced, priority encoders can feasibly accelerate a variety of key applications, such as high-precision integer arithmetic and content-addressable memory. We propose a new paradigm for constructing priority encoders by generalizing the previously proposed two-level priority encoder structure. We extend this concept to three and four levels using two techniques -- cascading and composition -- and discuss further generalization. We then analyze the complexity and delay of new and existing priority encoder designs as a function of input length, for both FPGA and ASIC implementation technologies. In particular, we compare the multi-level structure to the traditional single-level priority encoder structure, a tree-based design, a recursive design, and the two-level structure. We find that the two-level architecture provides balanced performance -- reducing complexity by around half, but at the cost of a corresponding increase in delay. Additional levels have diminishing returns, highlighting a tradeoff between complexity and delay. Meanwhile, the tree and recursive designs are generally faster, but are more complex than the two-level and multi-level structures. We explore several characteristics and patterns of the designs across a wide range of input lengths. We then provide recommendations on which architecture to use for a given input length and implementation technology, based on which design factors -- such as complexity or delay -- are most important to the hardware designer. With this overview and analysis of various priority encoder architectures, we provide a priority encoder toolkit to assist hardware designers in creating the most optimal design."}

This is particularly compelling in the AI domain, where rapid technological advancements and fierce global competition have led the United States to recently implement export control regulations limiting international access to advanced AI chips. For this reason, this paper studies technical progress in NVIDIA datacenter GPUs released from the mid-2000s until today. Specifically, we compile a comprehensive dataset of datacenter NVIDIA GPUs comprising several features, ranging from computational performance to release price. Then, we examine trends in main GPU features and estimate progress indicators for per-memory bandwidth, per-dollar, and per-watt increase rates. Our main results identify doubling times of 1.44 and 1.69 years for FP16 and FP32 operations (without accounting for sparsity benefits), while FP64 doubling times range from 2.06 to 3.79 years. Off-chip memory size and bandwidth grew at slower rates than computing performance, doubling every 3.32 to 3.53 years. The release prices of datacenter GPUs have roughly doubled every 5.1 years, while their power consumption has approximately doubled every 16 years. Finally, we quantify the potential implications of current U.S. export control regulations in terms of the potential performance gaps that would result if implementation were assumed to be complete and successful. We find that recently proposed changes to export controls would shrink the potential performance gap from 23.6x to 3.54x."}
