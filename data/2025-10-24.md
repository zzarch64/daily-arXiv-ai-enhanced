Abstract: The design of approximate adders has been widely researched to advance
energy-efficient hardware for computation-intensive multimedia applications,
such as image, audio, or video processing. The design of approximate adders has
been widely researched to advance energy-efficient hardware for computation
intensive multimedia applications, such as image/audio/video processing.
Several static and dynamic approximate adders exist in the literature, each of
which endeavors to balance the conflicting demands of high performance,
computational accuracy, and energy efficiency. This work introduces a novel
approximate adder that is more energy- and area-efficient than existing adders,
while achieving improved or comparable accuracy, as demonstrated by simulation
results. The proposed adder's ability to digitally reconstruct high quality
images is further demonstrated by the deployment of the design for an image
processing task.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有DRAM基础的真随机数生成器在性能和效率方面存在局限，需要开发更高吞吐量的解决方案。

Method: 对96个DDR4 DRAM芯片进行广泛表征，研究不同同时激活行数(2,4,8,16,32)、数据模式、温度水平和空间变化对SiMRA真随机生成潜力的影响。

Result: 所有SiMRA基础TRNG设计都通过NIST随机性测试；2、8、16、32行激活设计比现有最优DRAM基础TRNG吞吐量分别提高1.15x、1.99x、1.82x、1.39x；熵随激活行数增加而增加；操作参数显著影响熵。

Conclusion: SiMRA技术为DRAM基础真随机数生成提供了高效解决方案，同时激活行数越多熵越高，但温度和操作条件会影响性能。

Abstract: In this work, we experimentally demonstrate that it is possible to generate
true random numbers at high throughput and low latency in commercial
off-the-shelf (COTS) DRAM chips by leveraging simultaneous multiple-row
activation (SiMRA) via an extensive characterization of 96 DDR4 DRAM chips. We
rigorously analyze SiMRA's true random generation potential in terms of
entropy, latency, and throughput for varying numbers of simultaneously
activated DRAM rows (i.e., 2, 4, 8, 16, and 32), data patterns, temperature
levels, and spatial variations. Among our 11 key experimental observations, we
highlight four key results. First, we evaluate the quality of our TRNG designs
using the commonly-used NIST statistical test suite for randomness and find
that all SiMRA-based TRNG designs successfully pass each test. Second, 2-, 8-,
16-, and 32-row activation-based TRNG designs outperform the state-of-theart
DRAM-based TRNG in throughput by up to 1.15x, 1.99x, 1.82x, and 1.39x,
respectively. Third, SiMRA's entropy tends to increase with the number of
simultaneously activated DRAM rows. Fourth, operational parameters and
conditions (e.g., data pattern and temperature) significantly affect entropy.
For example, for most of the tested modules, the average entropy of 32-row
activation is 2.51x higher than that of 2-row activation. For example,
increasing the temperature from 50{\deg}C to 90{\deg}C decreases SiMRA's
entropy by 1.53x for 32-row activation. To aid future research and development,
we open-source our infrastructure at https://github.com/CMU-SAFARI/SiMRA-TRNG.

TL;DR: Squire是一种通用加速器，旨在有效利用依赖绑定内核中的细粒度并行性，通过低功耗核心和直接L2缓存访问实现高达7.64倍加速和56%能耗降低。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统通用加速器（如SIMD和GPGPU）在处理复杂数据依赖模式时存在效率问题，而定制FPGA/ASIC设计成本高且缺乏灵活性。需要一种能有效处理依赖绑定内核的通用加速方案。

Method: 每个Squire加速器包含一组低功耗顺序核心，这些核心能快速相互通信并直接访问L2缓存。在多核系统中每个核心集成一个Squire加速器，以最小软件修改加速并行任务中的依赖绑定内核。

Result: 在动态编程内核中获得高达7.64倍加速，端到端应用整体加速3.66倍。能耗降低达56%，与Neoverse-N1基线相比仅增加10.5%的面积开销。

Conclusion: Squire提供了一种高效处理依赖绑定内核的通用加速方案，在保持低面积开销的同时显著提升性能和能效。

Abstract: Multiple HPC applications are often bottlenecked by compute-intensive kernels
implementing complex dependency patterns (data-dependency bound). Traditional
general-purpose accelerators struggle to effectively exploit fine-grain
parallelism due to limitations in implementing convoluted data-dependency
patterns (like SIMD) and overheads due to synchronization and data transfers
(like GPGPUs). In contrast, custom FPGA and ASIC designs offer improved
performance and energy efficiency at a high cost in hardware design and
programming complexity and often lack the flexibility to process different
workloads. We propose Squire, a general-purpose accelerator designed to exploit
fine-grain parallelism effectively on dependency-bound kernels. Each Squire
accelerator has a set of general-purpose low-power in-order cores that can
rapidly communicate among themselves and directly access data from the L2
cache. Our proposal integrates one Squire accelerator per core in a typical
multicore system, allowing the acceleration of dependency-bound kernels within
parallel tasks with minimal software changes. As a case study, we evaluate
Squire's effectiveness by accelerating five kernels that implement complex
dependency patterns. We use three of these kernels to build an end-to-end
read-mapping tool that will be used to evaluate Squire. Squire obtains speedups
up to 7.64$\times$ in dynamic programming kernels. Overall, Squire provides an
acceleration for an end-to-end application of 3.66$\times$. In addition, Squire
reduces energy consumption by up to 56% with a minimal area overhead of 10.5%
compared to a Neoverse-N1 baseline.
