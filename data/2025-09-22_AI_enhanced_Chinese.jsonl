ASIPs are often derived from off-the-shelf\nGPPs extended by custom instructions tailored towards a specific software\nworkload. One of the most important challenges of designing an ASIP is to find\nsaid custom instructions that help to increase performance without being too\ncostly in terms of area and power consumption. To date, solving this challenge\nis relatively labor-intensive and typically performed manually. Addressing the\nlack of automation, we present Custom Instruction Designer for RISC-V\nExtensions (CIDRE), a front-to-back tool for ASIP design. CIDRE automatically\nanalyzes hotspots in RISC-V applications and generates custom instruction\nsuggestions with a corresponding nML description. The nML description can be\nused with other electronic design automation tools to accurately assess the\ncost and benefits of the found suggestions. In a RISC-V benchmark study, we\nwere able to accelerate embedded benchmarks from Embench and MiBench by up to\n2.47x with less than 24% area increase. The entire process was conducted\ncompletely automatically.", "AI": {"tldr": "CIDRE\u662f\u4e00\u4e2a\u81ea\u52a8\u5316\u5de5\u5177\uff0c\u7528\u4e8e\u4e3aRISC-V\u5904\u7406\u5668\u8bbe\u8ba1\u5b9a\u5236\u6307\u4ee4\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u5206\u6790\u5e94\u7528\u7a0b\u5e8f\u70ed\u70b9\u81ea\u52a8\u751f\u6210\u5b9a\u5236\u6307\u4ee4\u5efa\u8bae\uff0c\u5728\u5d4c\u5165\u5f0f\u57fa\u51c6\u6d4b\u8bd5\u4e2d\u5b9e\u73b0\u6700\u9ad82.47\u500d\u7684\u52a0\u901f\u6548\u679c\u3002", "motivation": "ASIP\u8bbe\u8ba1\u76ee\u524d\u4e3b\u8981\u4f9d\u8d56\u624b\u52a8\u5de5\u4f5c\uff0c\u7f3a\u4e4f\u81ea\u52a8\u5316\u5de5\u5177\u3002\u73b0\u6709\u7684\u5b9a\u5236\u6307\u4ee4\u8bbe\u8ba1\u8fc7\u7a0b\u52b3\u52a8\u5bc6\u96c6\u4e14\u6548\u7387\u4f4e\u4e0b\uff0c\u9700\u8981\u81ea\u52a8\u5316\u89e3\u51b3\u65b9\u6848\u6765\u63d0\u9ad8\u8bbe\u8ba1\u6548\u7387\u3002", "method": "\u5f00\u53d1\u4e86CIDRE\u5de5\u5177\uff0c\u81ea\u52a8\u5206\u6790RISC-V\u5e94\u7528\u7a0b\u5e8f\u7684\u70ed\u70b9\uff0c\u751f\u6210\u5b9a\u5236\u6307\u4ee4\u5efa\u8bae\u548c\u5bf9\u5e94\u7684nML\u63cf\u8ff0\u3002nML\u63cf\u8ff0\u53ef\u7528\u4e8eEDA\u5de5\u5177\u51c6\u786e\u8bc4\u4f30\u5efa\u8bae\u7684\u6210\u672c\u548c\u6536\u76ca\u3002", "result": "\u5728RISC-V\u57fa\u51c6\u6d4b\u8bd5\u4e2d\uff0cEmbench\u548cMiBench\u5d4c\u5165\u5f0f\u57fa\u51c6\u6d4b\u8bd5\u52a0\u901f\u6700\u9ad8\u8fbe2.47\u500d\uff0c\u9762\u79ef\u589e\u52a0\u5c0f\u4e8e24%\u3002\u6574\u4e2a\u8fc7\u7a0b\u5b8c\u5168\u81ea\u52a8\u5316\u5b8c\u6210\u3002", "conclusion": "CIDRE\u8bc1\u660e\u4e86ASIP\u8bbe\u8ba1\u81ea\u52a8\u5316\u7684\u53ef\u884c\u6027\uff0c\u4e3aRISC-V\u5904\u7406\u5668\u5b9a\u5236\u6307\u4ee4\u8bbe\u8ba1\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u6709\u6548\u7684\u7aef\u5230\u7aef\u81ea\u52a8\u5316\u89e3\u51b3\u65b9\u6848\u3002"}}
