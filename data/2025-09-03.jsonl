Recent breakthroughs combine SLAM with 3D Gaussian Splatting\n(3DGS) to achieve exceptional reconstruction fidelity. However, existing\n3DGS-SLAM systems provide insufficient throughput due to the need for multiple\ntraining iterations per frame and the vast number of Gaussians.\n  In this paper, we propose AGS, an algorithm-hardware co-design framework to\nboost the efficiency of 3DGS-SLAM based on the intuition that SLAM systems\nprocess frames in a streaming manner, where adjacent frames exhibit high\nsimilarity that can be utilized for acceleration. On the software level: 1) We\npropose a coarse-then-fine-grained pose tracking method with respect to the\nrobot's movement. 2) We avoid redundant computations of Gaussians by sharing\ntheir contribution information across frames. On the hardware level, we propose\na frame covisibility detection engine to extract intermediate data from the\nvideo CODEC. We also implement a pose tracking engine and a mapping engine with\nworkload schedulers to efficiently deploy the AGS algorithm.

Despite these advancements, 3D-GS still\nstruggles to meet the frames per second (FPS) demands of real-time\napplications. In this paper, we introduce GS-TG, a tile-grouping-based\naccelerator that enhances 3D-GS rendering speed by reducing redundant sorting\noperations and preserving rasterization efficiency. GS-TG addresses a critical\ntrade-off issue in 3D-GS rendering: increasing the tile size effectively\nreduces redundant sorting operations, but it concurrently increases unnecessary\nrasterization computations. So, during sorting of the proposed approach, GS-TG\ngroups small tiles (for making large tiles) to share sorting operations across\ntiles within each group, significantly reducing redundant computations. During\nrasterization, a bitmask assigned to each Gaussian identifies relevant small\ntiles, to enable efficient sharing of sorting results. Consequently, GS-TG\nenables sorting to be performed as if a large tile size is used by grouping\ntiles during the sorting stage, while allowing rasterization to proceed with\nthe original small tiles by using bitmasks in the rasterization stage. GS-TG is\na lossless method requiring no retraining or fine-tuning and it can be\nseamlessly integrated with previous 3D-GS optimization techniques. Experimental\nresults show that GS-TG achieves an average speed-up of 1.54 times over\nstate-of-the-art 3D-GS accelerators."}
