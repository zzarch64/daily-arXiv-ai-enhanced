However, existing mapping space exploration efforts for such accelerators primarily focus on traditional CNN/Transformer workloads and fail to adequately support the dynamic behaviors of mixed request types and variable sequence lengths in real-world LLM inference serving. To bridge this gap, we first propose a computation execution graph-based mapping encoding scheme that decouples micro-batches and layers, enabling fine-grained execution control on heterogeneous chiplets and flexibly representing various parallelism strategies. Second, building upon this scheme, we develop the Compass framework, which integrates an evaluation engine and a genetic algorithm-based mapping generation engine to achieve efficient mapping search. Compared to state-of-the-art works, our solution achieves an average EDP reduction of 63.12%."}

We present MERINDA, an FPGA-accelerated MR framework that restructures computation as a streaming dataflow pipeline. MERINDA exploits on-chip locality through BRAM tiling, fixed-point kernels, and the concurrent use of LUT fabric and carry-chain adders to expose fine-grained spatial parallelism while minimizing off-chip traffic. This hardware-aware formulation removes synchronization bottlenecks and sustains high throughput across the iterative updates in MR. On representative MR workloads, MERINDA delivers up to 6.3x fewer cycles than an FPGA-based LTC baseline, enabling real-time performance for time-critical physical systems."}

However, in some image data, input features can be spatially sparse, and semantic information may occupy only a small fraction of the input pixels. In this case most computation would be wasted on empty regions. In this work, we introduce SparsePixels, a framework for efficient convolution for spatially sparse image data on FPGAs, targeting fast inference applications in constrained environments with latency requirements of microseconds or below. Our approach implements a special class of CNNs that selectively retain and compute on a small subset of pixels that are active while ignoring the rest. We show that, for example, in a neutrino physics dataset for identifying neutrino interactions in LArTPC images that have around 4k input pixels but are naturally very sparse, a standard CNN with a compact size of 4k parameters incurs an inference latency of 48.665 $μ$s on an FPGA, whereas a sparse CNN of the same base architecture computing on less than 1% of the input pixels results in a $\\times 73$ inference speedup to 0.665 $μ$s, with resource utilization well within on-chip budgets, trading only a small percent-level performance loss. At least one-order-of magnitude speedups with comparable performance are also demonstrated in similar datasets with sparse image patterns. This work aims to benefit future algorithm developments for fast and efficient data readout in modern experiments such as the trigger and data acquisition systems at the CERN Large Hadron Collider. For easy adoption, we have developed a library to support building sparse CNNs with quantization-aware training, as well as an HLS implementation for FPGA deployment."}

To address this, we propose an LSTM accelerator incorporating an ACIM macro with reconfigurable (1-5 bit) nonlinear in-memory (NLIM) analog-to-digital converter (ADC) to compute NL activations directly in the analog domain using: 1) a dual 9T bitcell with decoupled read/write paths for signed inputs and ternary weight operations; 2) a read-word-line underdrive Cascode (RUDC) technique achieving 2.8X higher read-bitline dynamic range than single-transistor designs (1.4X better over conventional Cascode structure with 7X lower current variation); 3) a dual-supply 6T-SRAM array for efficient multi-bit weight operations and reducing both bitcell count (7.8X) and latency (4X) for 5-bit weight operations. We experimentally demonstrate 5-bit NLIM ADC for approximating NL activations in LSTM cells, achieving average error <1 LSB. Simulation confirms the robustness of NLIM ADC against temperature variations thanks to the replica bias strategy. Our design achieves 92.0% on-chip inference accuracy for a 12-class keyword-spotting task while demonstrating 2.2X higher system-level normalized energy efficiency and 1.6X better normalized area efficiency than state-of-the-art works. The results combine physical measurements of a macro unit-accounting for the majority of LSTM operations (99% linear and 80% nonlinear operations)-with simulations of the remaining components, including additional LSTM and fully connected layers."}

However, a rigorous mathematical characterization of how AxMs error distributions influence DNN accuracy remains underdeveloped. This work presents an analytical framework that connects the statistical error moments of an AxM to the induced distortion in General Matrix Multiplication (GEMM). Using the Frobenius norm of the resulting error matrix, we derive a closed form expression for practical DNN dimensions that demonstrates the distortion is predominantly governed by the multiplier mean error (bias). To evaluate this model in realistic settings, we incorporate controlled error injection into GEMM and convolution layers and examine its effect on ImageNet scale networks. The predicted distortion correlates strongly with the observed accuracy degradation, and an error configurable AxM case study implemented on an FPGA further confirms the analytical trends. By providing a lightweight alternative to behavioral or hardware level simulations, this framework enables rapid estimation of AxM impact on DNN inference quality."}

Accurate CPU power evaluation requires designers to go through the whole time-consuming IC implementation process, easily taking months. At the early design stage (e.g., architecture-level), classical power models are notoriously inaccurate. Recently, ML-based architecture-level power models have been proposed to boost accuracy, but the data availability is a severe challenge. Currently, there is no open-source dataset for this important ML application. A typical dataset generation process involves correct CPU design implementation and repetitive execution of power simulation flows, requiring significant design expertise, engineering effort, and execution time. Even private in-house datasets often fail to reflect realistic CPU design scenarios. In this work, we propose ArchPower, the first open-source dataset for architecture-level processor power modeling. We go through complex and realistic design flows to collect the CPU architectural information as features and the ground-truth simulated power as labels. Our dataset includes 200 CPU data samples, collected from 25 different CPU configurations when executing 8 different workloads. There are more than 100 architectural features in each data sample, including both hardware and event parameters. The label of each sample provides fine-grained power information, including the total design power and the power for each of the 11 components. Each power value is further decomposed into four fine-grained power groups: combinational logic power, sequential logic power, memory power, and clock power. ArchPower is available at https://github.com/hkust-zhiyao/ArchPower."}

Instead of further complicating software development with deeply hierarchical scratchpad memories (SPMs) and their asynchronous management, we investigate the opposite point of the design spectrum: a multi-core AI accelerator equipped with a shared system-level cache and application-aware management policies, which keeps the programming effort modest. Our approach exploits dataflow information available in the software stack to guide cache replacement (including dead-block prediction), in concert with bypass decisions and mechanisms that alleviate cache thrashing.\n  We assess the proposal using a cycle-accurate simulator and observe substantial performance gains (up to 1.80x speedup) compared with conventional cache architectures. In addition, we build and validate an analytical model that takes into account the actual overlapping behaviors to extend the measurement results of our policies to real-world larger-scale workloads. Experiment results show that when functioning together, our bypassing and thrashing mitigation strategies can handle scenarios both with and without inter-core data sharing and achieve remarkable speedups.\n  Finally, we implement the design in RTL and the area of our design is $\\mathbf{0.064mm^2}$ with 15nm process, which can run at 2 GHz clock frequency.
