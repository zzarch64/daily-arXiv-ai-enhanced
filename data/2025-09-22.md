Motivation: ASIP设计目前主要依赖手动工作，缺乏自动化工具。现有的定制指令设计过程劳动密集且效率低下，需要自动化解决方案来提高设计效率。

Method: 开发了CIDRE工具，自动分析RISC-V应用程序的热点，生成定制指令建议和对应的nML描述。nML描述可用于EDA工具准确评估建议的成本和收益。

Result: 在RISC-V基准测试中，Embench和MiBench嵌入式基准测试加速最高达2.47倍，面积增加小于24%。整个过程完全自动化完成。

Conclusion: CIDRE证明了ASIP设计自动化的可行性，为RISC-V处理器定制指令设计提供了有效的端到端自动化解决方案。

Abstract: An Application-Specific Instruction Set Processor(ASIP) is a specialized
microprocessor that provides a trade-off between the programmability of a
General Purpose Processor (GPP) and the performance and energy-efficiency of
dedicated hardware accelerators. ASIPs are often derived from off-the-shelf
GPPs extended by custom instructions tailored towards a specific software
workload. One of the most important challenges of designing an ASIP is to find
said custom instructions that help to increase performance without being too
costly in terms of area and power consumption. To date, solving this challenge
is relatively labor-intensive and typically performed manually. Addressing the
lack of automation, we present Custom Instruction Designer for RISC-V
Extensions (CIDRE), a front-to-back tool for ASIP design. CIDRE automatically
analyzes hotspots in RISC-V applications and generates custom instruction
suggestions with a corresponding nML description. The nML description can be
used with other electronic design automation tools to accurately assess the
cost and benefits of the found suggestions. In a RISC-V benchmark study, we
were able to accelerate embedded benchmarks from Embench and MiBench by up to
2.47x with less than 24% area increase. The entire process was conducted
completely automatically.
