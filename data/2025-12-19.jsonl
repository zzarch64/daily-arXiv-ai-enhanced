No part of this work was conducted at, funded by, or related to the author's current employer", "summary": "Conditional branch prediction predicts the likely direction of a conditional branch instruction to support ILP extraction. Branch prediction is a pattern recognition problem that learns mappings between a context to the branch outcome. An accurate predictor reduces the number of instructions executed on the wrong path resulting in an improvement of performance and energy consumption. In this paper, we present a workload characterization methodology for branch prediction. We propose two new workload-driven branch prediction accuracy identifiers -- branch working set size and branch predictability. These parameters are highly correlated with misprediction rates of modern branch prediction schemes (e.g. TAGE and perceptron). We define the branch working set of a trace as a group of most frequently occurring branch contexts, i.e. the 3-part tuple of branch address, and associated global and local history. We analyze the branch working set's size and predictability on a per-trace basis to study its relationship with a modern branch predictor's accuracy. We have characterized 2,451 workload traces into seven branch working set size and nine predictability categories after analyzing their branch behavior. We present further insights into the source of prediction accuracy and favored workload categories for modern branch predictors."}

Lee", "Tanfer Alan", "Sung Kim", "Ecenur Ustun", "Amr Suleiman", "Ajit Krisshna", "Tim Balbekov", "Armin Alaghi", "Richard Newcombe"], "title": "Full System Architecture Modeling for Wearable Egocentric Contextual AI", "comment": "13 pages, 3 tables, 6 figures, technical report", "summary": "The next generation of human-oriented computing will require always-on, spatially-aware wearable devices to capture egocentric vision and functional primitives (e.g., Where am I? What am I looking at?, etc.). These devices will sense an egocentric view of the world around us to observe all human- relevant signals across space and time to construct and maintain a user's personal context. This personal context, combined with advanced generative AI, will unlock a powerful new generation of contextual AI personal assistants and applications. However, designing a wearable system to support contextual AI is a daunting task because of the system's complexity and stringent power constraints due to weight and battery restrictions. To understand how to guide design for such systems, this work provides the first complete system architecture view of one such wearable contextual AI system (Aria2), along with the lessons we have learned through the system modeling and design space exploration process. We show that an end-to-end full system model view of such systems is vitally important, as no single component or category overwhelmingly dominates system power. This means long-range design decisions and power optimizations need to be made in the full system context to avoid running into limits caused by other system bottlenecks (i.e., Amdahl's law as applied to power) or as bottlenecks change. Finally, we reflect on lessons and insights for the road ahead, which will be important toward eventually enabling all-day, wearable, contextual AI systems."}
