While these enhancements improve power, performance, and area\n(PPA), they complicate design space exploration and application optimization\ndue to complex resource interactions.\n  To address these challenges, we propose a lightweight profiling methodology\ninspired by the Roofline model. It introduces three congruence scores that\nquickly identify bottlenecks related to heterogeneous resources, fabric, and\napplication logic. Evaluated on the Koios and VPR benchmark suites using a\nStratix 10 like FPGA, this approach enables efficient FPGA architecture\nco-design to improve heterogeneous FPGA performance."}

Bharadwaj"], "title": "Chiplet-Based RISC-V SoC with Modular AI Acceleration", "comment": "3 pages, 3 figures and 2 tables", "summary": "Achieving high performance, energy efficiency, and cost-effectiveness while\nmaintaining architectural flexibility is a critical challenge in the\ndevelopment and deployment of edge AI devices. Monolithic SoC designs struggle\nwith this complex balance mainly due to low manufacturing yields (below 16%) at\nadvanced 360 mm^2 process nodes. This paper presents a novel chiplet-based\nRISC-V SoC architecture that addresses these limitations through modular AI\nacceleration and intelligent system level optimization. Our proposed design\nintegrates 4 different key innovations in a 30mm x 30mm silicon interposer:\nadaptive cross-chiplet Dynamic Voltage and Frequency Scaling (DVFS); AI-aware\nUniversal Chiplet Interconnect Express (UCIe) protocol extensions featuring\nstreaming flow control units and compression-aware transfers; distributed\ncryptographic security across heterogeneous chiplets; and intelligent\nsensor-driven load migration. The proposed architecture integrates a 7nm RISC-V\nCPU chiplet with dual 5nm AI accelerators (15 TOPS INT8 each), 16GB HBM3 memory\nstacks, and dedicated power management controllers. Experimental results across\nindustry standard benchmarks like MobileNetV2, ResNet-50 and real-time video\nprocessing demonstrate significant performance improvements. The AI-optimized\nconfiguration achieves ~14.7% latency reduction, 17.3% throughput improvement,\nand 16.2% power reduction compared to previous basic chiplet implementations.\nThese improvements collectively translate to a 40.1% efficiency gain\ncorresponding to ~3.5 mJ per MobileNetV2 inference (860 mW/244 images/s), while\nmaintaining sub-5ms real-time capability across all experimented workloads.\nThese performance upgrades demonstrate that modular chiplet designs can achieve\nnear-monolithic computational density while enabling cost efficiency,\nscalability and upgradeability, crucial for next-generation edge AI device\napplications."}
