Existing test strategies, including histogram-based approaches, sine wave testing, and model-driven reconstruction, often rely on dense data acquisition followed by offline post-processing, which increases overall test time and complexity.

UGLMS is a closed-loop test strategy that adaptively selects SAR ADC code edges based on model uncertainty and refines a behavioral mismatch model in real time via an Extended Kalman Filter (EKF), eliminating full-range sweeps and offline post-processing. We introduce an enhanced UGLMS that delivers significantly faster test runtimes while maintaining estimation accuracy. First, a rank-1 EKF update replaces costly matrix inversions with efficient vector operations, and a measurement-aligned covariance-inflation strategy accelerates convergence under unexpected innovations. Second, we extend the static mismatch model with a low-order carrier polynomial to capture systematic nonlinearities beyond pure capacitor mismatch. Third, a trace-based termination adapts test length to convergence, preventing premature stops and redundant iterations. Simulations show the enhanced UGLMS reconstructs full Integral- and Differential-Non-Linearity (INL/DNL) in just 36 ms for 16-bit and under 70 ms for 18-bit ADCs (120 ms with the polynomial extension). Combining the faster convergence from covariance inflation with reduced per-iteration runtime from the rank-1 EKF update, the method reaches equal accuracy 8x faster for 16-bit ADCs.

Existing video generation models are predominantly based on the video diffusion transformer (vDiT), however, they suffer from substantial inference delay due to self-attention. While prior studies have focused on reducing redundant computations in self-attention, they often overlook the inherent spatio-temporal correlations in video streams and directly leverage sparsity patterns from large language models to reduce attention computations.\n  In this work, we take a principled approach to accelerate self-attention in vDiTs by leveraging the spatio-temporal correlations in the latent space. We show that the attention patterns within vDiT are primarily due to the dominant spatial and temporal correlations at the token channel level. Based on this insight, we propose a lightweight and adaptive reuse strategy that approximates attention computations by reusing partial attention scores of spatially or temporally correlated tokens along individual channels.

Inference, particularly the decoding phase, is dominated by memory-bound GEMV or flat GEMM operations with low operational intensity (OI), making it well-suited for processing-in-memory (PIM) approaches. However, existing in/near-memory solutions face critical limitations such as reduced memory capacity due to the high area cost of integrating processing elements (PEs) within DRAM chips, and limited PE capability due to the constraints of DRAM fabrication technology. This work presents a chiplet-based memory module that addresses these limitations by decoupling logic and memory into chiplets fabricated in heterogeneous technology nodes and connected via an interposer. The logic chiplets sustain high bandwidth access to the DRAM chiplets, which house the memory banks, and enable the integration of advanced processing components such as systolic arrays and SRAM-based buffers to accelerate memory-bound GEMM kernels, capabilities that were not feasible in prior PIM architectures. We propose Sangam, a CXL-attached PIM-chiplet based memory module that can either act as a drop-in replacement for GPUs or co-executes along side the GPUs. Sangam achieves speedup of 3.93, 4.22, 2.82x speedup in end-to-end query latency, 10.3, 9.5, 6.36x greater decoding throughput, and order of magnitude energy savings compared to an H100 GPU for varying input size, output length, and batch size on LLaMA 2-7B, Mistral-7B, and LLaMA 3-70B, respectively.", "AI": {"tldr": "Sangam\u662f\u4e00\u4e2a\u57fa\u4e8eCXL\u8fde\u63a5\u7684PIM-chiplet\u5185\u5b58\u6a21\u5757\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u5c06\u903b\u8f91\u548c\u5185\u5b58\u89e3\u8026\u5230\u4e0d\u540c\u5de5\u827a\u8282\u70b9\u7684chiplet\u4e2d\u6765\u89e3\u51b3\u73b0\u6709\u5185\u5b58\u8ba1\u7b97\u65b9\u6848\u7684\u5c40\u9650\u6027\uff0c\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u63a8\u7406\u6027\u80fd\u3002", "motivation": "\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u53d8\u5f97\u65e5\u76ca\u6570\u636e\u5bc6\u96c6\uff0c\u63a8\u7406\u9636\u6bb5\u7279\u522b\u662f\u89e3\u7801\u9636\u6bb5\u53d7\u9650\u4e8e\u5185\u5b58\u5e26\u5bbd\uff0c\u800c\u73b0\u6709\u7684\u5185\u5b58\u8ba1\u7b97\u65b9\u6848\u9762\u4e34\u5185\u5b58\u5bb9\u91cf\u51cf\u5c11\u548c\u5904\u7406\u80fd\u529b\u6709\u9650\u7684\u95ee\u9898\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51fachiplet-based\u5185\u5b58\u6a21\u5757\uff0c\u5c06\u903b\u8f91\u548cDRAM\u89e3\u8026\u5230\u4e0d\u540c\u5de5\u827a\u8282\u70b9\u7684chiplet\u4e2d\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u4e2d\u4ecb\u5c42\u8fde\u63a5\uff0c\u903b\u8f91chiplet\u652f\u6301\u9ad8\u5e26\u5bbd\u8bbf\u95eeDRAM chiplet\uff0c\u96c6\u6210\u8109\u52a8\u9635\u5217\u548cSRAM\u7f13\u51b2\u533a\u6765\u52a0\u901f\u5185\u5b58\u5bc6\u96c6\u578bGEMM\u64cd\u4f5c\u3002", "result": "\u76f8\u6bd4H100 GPU\uff0cSangam\u5728LLaMA 2-7B\u3001Mistral-7B\u548cLLaMA 3-70B\u4e0a\u5206\u522b\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e863.93\u30014.22\u30012.82\u500d\u7684\u7aef\u5230\u7aef\u67e5\u8be2\u5ef6\u8fdf\u52a0\u901f\uff0c10.3\u30019.5\u30016.36\u500d\u7684\u89e3\u7801\u541e\u5410\u91cf\u63d0\u5347\uff0c\u4ee5\u53ca\u6570\u91cf\u7ea7\u7684\u80fd\u8017\u8282\u7701\u3002", "conclusion": "Sangam\u67b6\u6784\u901a\u8fc7\u5f02\u6784chiplet\u8bbe\u8ba1\u6709\u6548\u89e3\u51b3\u4e86\u73b0\u6709PIM\u65b9\u6848\u7684\u5c40\u9650\u6027\uff0c\u4e3a\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u63a8\u7406\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u663e\u8457\u6027\u80fd\u63d0\u5347\u548c\u80fd\u6548\u4f18\u5316\u3002"}}

As a result, high-end processors typically feature lower memory bandwidth per core, at the detriment of memory-intensive workloads. We propose alleviating this challenge by improving the utility of the CPU's limited pins. In a typical CPU design process, the available pins are apportioned between memory and I/O traffic, each accounting for about half of the total off-chip bandwidth availability. Consequently, unless both memory and I/O are simultaneously highly utilized, such fragmentation leads to underutilization of the valuable off-chip bandwidth resources. An ideal architecture would offer I/O and memory bandwidth fungibility, allowing use of the aggregate off-chip bandwidth in the form required by each workload.\n  In this work, we introduce SURGE, a software-supported architectural technique that boosts memory bandwidth availability by salvaging idle I/O bandwidth resources. SURGE leverages the capability of versatile interconnect technologies like CXL to dynamically multiplex memory and I/O traffic over the same processor interface.

However, existing solutions struggle to achieve high frame rates, especially for high-resolution rendering. Our analysis identifies the sorting stage in the 3DGS rendering pipeline as the major bottleneck due to its high memory bandwidth demand. This paper presents Neo, which introduces a reuse-and-update sorting algorithm that exploits temporal redundancy in Gaussian ordering across consecutive frames, and devises a hardware accelerator optimized for this algorithm. By efficiently tracking and updating Gaussian depth ordering instead of re-sorting from scratch, Neo significantly reduces redundant computations and memory bandwidth pressure. Experimental results show that Neo achieves up to 10.0x and 5.6x higher throughput than state-of-the-art edge GPU and ASIC solution, respectively, while reducing DRAM traffic by 94.5% and 81.3%.

However, challenges remain in ensuring the quality of Verilog generation. Complex designs often fail in a single generation due to the lack of targeted decoupling strategies, and evaluating the correctness of decoupled sub-tasks remains difficult. While the chain-of-thought (CoT) method is commonly used to improve LLM reasoning, it has been largely ineffective in automating IC design workflows, requiring manual intervention. The key issue is controlling CoT reasoning direction and step granularity, which do not align with expert RTL design knowledge. This paper introduces VeriBToT, a specialized LLM reasoning paradigm for automated Verilog generation. By integrating Top-down and design-for-verification (DFV) approaches, VeriBToT achieves self-decoupling and self-verification of intermediate steps, constructing a Backtrack Tree of Thought with formal operators.

As weathering depends on many factors, it is also difficult to link its progression to climatic changes. To predict weathering, it is essential to gather climatic data while simultaneously monitoring the progression of deterioration. The multimodal nature of collected data (images, text{\\ldots}) makes correlations difficult, particularly on different time scales. To address this issue, the COLISEUM project proposes a methodology for collecting data in three French sites to predict heritage material behaviour using artificial intelligence computer models. Over time, prediction models will allow the prediction of future material behaviours using known data from different climate change scenarios by the IPCC (Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change). Thus, a climate monitoring methodology has been set up in three cultural sites in France: Notre-Dame cathedral in Strasbourg ( 67), Bibracte archaeological site (71), and the Saint-Pierre chapel in Villefranche-sur-Mer (06). Each site has a different climate and specific materials. In situ, microclimatic sensors continuously record variations parameters over time. The state of alteration is monitored at regular intervals by means of chemical analyses, cartographic measurements and scientific imaging campaigns. To implement weathering models, data is gathered in alteration matrix by mean of a calculated weathering index.

This paper presents T-SAR, the first framework to achieve scalable ternary LLM inference on CPUs by repurposing the SIMD register file for dynamic, in-register LUT generation with minimal hardware modifications. T-SAR eliminates memory bottlenecks and maximizes data-level parallelism, delivering 5.6-24.5x and 1.1-86.2x improvements in GEMM latency and GEMV throughput, respectively, with only 3.2% power and 1.4% area overheads in SIMD units.
