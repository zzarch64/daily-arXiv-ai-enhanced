Efficient point-to-multipoint (P2MP) data movement, such as multicast, is essential for high performance. However, native multicast support is lacking in standard interconnect protocols. Existing P2MP solutions, such as multicast-capable Network-on-Chip (NoC), impose additional overhead to the network hardware and require modifications to the interconnect protocol, compromising scalability and compatibility.\n  This paper introduces Torrent, a novel distributed DMA architecture that enables efficient P2MP data transfers without modifying NoC hardware and interconnect protocol. Torrent conducts P2MP data transfers by forming logical chains over the NoC, where the data traverses through targeted destinations resembling a linked list. This Chainwrite mechanism preserves the P2P nature of every data transfer while enabling flexible data transfers to an unlimited number of destinations. To optimize the performance and energy consumption of Chainwrite, two scheduling algorithms are developed to determine the optimal chain order based on NoC topology.\n  Our RTL and FPGA prototype evaluations using both synthetic and real workloads demonstrate significant advantages in performance, flexibility, and scalability over network-layer multicast. Compared to the unicast baseline, Torrent achieves up to a 7.88x speedup. ASIC synthesis on 16nm technology confirms the architecture's minimal footprint in area (1.2%) and power (2.3%). Thanks to the Chainwrite, Torrent delivers scalable P2MP data transfers with a small cycle overhead of 82CC and area overhead of 207um2 per destination."}

Achieving low latency necessitates codes with short blocklengths for which polar codes with successive cancellation list (SCL) decoding typically outperform message-passing (MP)-based decoding of low-density parity-check (LDPC) codes. However, SCL decoders are known to exhibit high latency and poor area efficiency. In this paper, we propose a new short-blocklength multi-rate binary LDPC code that outperforms the 5G-LDPC code for the same blocklength and is suitable for URLLC applications using fully parallel MP. To demonstrate our code's efficacy, we present a 0.44mm$^2$ GlobalFoundries 22FDX LDPC decoder ASIC which supports three rates and achieves the lowest-in-class decoding latency of 14ns while reaching an information throughput of 9Gb/s at 62pJ/b energy efficiency for a rate-1/2 code with 128-bit blocklength."}
