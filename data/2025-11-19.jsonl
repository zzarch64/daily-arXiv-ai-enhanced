These challenges hinder scalable and accurate IMC acceleration as models grow.\n  We propose NL-DPE, a Non-Linear Dot Product Engine that overcomes these barriers. NL-DPE augments crosspoint arrays with RRAM-based Analog Content Addressable Memory (ACAM) to execute arbitrary non-linear functions and data-dependent matrix multiplications in the analog domain by transforming them into decision trees, fully eliminating ADCs. To address device noise, NL-DPE uses software-based Noise Aware Fine-tuning (NAF), requiring no in-device calibration. Experiments show that NL-DPE delivers 28X energy efficiency and 249X speedup over a GPU baseline, and 22X energy efficiency and 245X speedup over existing IMC accelerators, while maintaining high accuracy."}

However, they can hardly be employed in the same accelerator simultaneously because CIM requires structural compute patterns which are disrupted in sparse NNs. In this paper, we partially solve this issue by proposing a bit level weight reordering strategy which can realize compact mapping of sparse NN weight matrices onto Resistive Random Access Memory (RRAM) based NN Accelerators (RRAM-Acc). In specific, when weights are mapped to RRAM crossbars in a binary complement manner, we can observe that, which can also be mathematically proven, bit-level sparsity and similarity commonly exist in the crossbars. The bit reordering method treats bit sparsity as a special case of bit similarity, reserve only one column in a pair of columns that have identical bit values, and then map the compressed weight matrices into Operation Units (OU). The performance of our design is evaluated with typical NNs. Simulation results show a 61.24% average performance improvement and 1.51x-2.52x energy savings under different sparsity ratios, with only slight overhead compared to the state-of-the-art design."}
