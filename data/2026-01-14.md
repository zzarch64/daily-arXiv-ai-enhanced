  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有电路综合工具主要针对大规模电子芯片设计，而密码学需要针对小函数的专用工具。现有小函数工具限于5-6位，计算时间长

Method: 开发新工具（提供CodeOcean和GitHub代码），专门针对二次函数，在AND-depth 1约束下最小化AND门数量

Result: 工具能处理9位二次函数，比现有工具更高效，在6位以下能探索更大实现空间，首次达到9位规模

Conclusion: 新工具填补了小函数电路综合的空白，特别适用于密码学应用，能高效实现9位二次函数的最小AND门电路

Abstract: The problem of finding a minimal circuit to implement a given function is one of the oldest in electronics. It is known to be NP-hard. Still, many tools exist to find sub-optimal circuits to implement a function. In electronics, such tools are known as synthesisers. However, these synthesisers aim to implement very large functions (a whole electronic chip). In cryptography, the focus is on small functions, hence the necessity for new dedicated tools for small functions. Several tools exist to implement small functions. They differ by their algorithmic approach (some are based on Depth-First-Search as introduced by Ullrich in 2011, some are based on SAT-solvers like the tool desgined by Stoffelen in 2016, some non-generic tools use subfield decomposition) and by their optimisation criteria (some optimise for circuit size, others for circuit depth, and some for side-channel-protected implementations). However, these tools are limited to functions operating on less than 5 bits, sometimes 6 bits for quadratic functions, or to very simple functions. The limitation lies in a high computing time. We propose a new tool (The tool is provided alongside the IEEE article with CodeOcean and at https://github.com/seduval/implem-quad-sbox) to implement quadratic functions up to 9 bits within AND-depth 1, minimising the number of AND gates. This tool is more time-efficient than previous ones, allowing to explore larger implementations than others on 6 bits or less and allows to reach larger sizes, up to 9 bits.
