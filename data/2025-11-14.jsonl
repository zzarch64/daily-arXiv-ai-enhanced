However, that pioneering approach relied exclusively on shortest-path computations, which can fail to capture re- alistic travel behavior and thus reduce the utility of the anonymized data. To address this limitation, this paper introduces a novel, history-aware trajectory k-anonymization methodology and presents an advanced FPGA-based hardware architecture to implement it. Our proposed architecture uniquely integrates par- allel history-based trajectory searches with conventional shortest- path finding, using a custom fixed-point counting module to ac- curately weigh contributions from historical data. This approach enables the system to prioritize behaviorally common routes over geometrically shorter but less-traveled paths. The FPGA implementation demonstrates that our new architecture achieves a real-time throughput of over 6,000 records/s, improves data retention by up to 1.2% compared to our previous shortest-path- only design, and preserves major arterial roads more effectively. These results signify a key advancement, enabling high-fidelity, history-aware anonymization that preserves both privacy and behavioral accuracy under the strict latency constraints of LBS."}

Existing assertion generation methods based on design specifications typically produce only top-level assertions, overlooking verification needs on the implementation details in the modules at the micro-architectural level, where design errors occur more frequently. To address this limitation, we present AssertMiner, a module-level assertion generation framework that leverages static information generated from abstract syntax tree (AST) to assist LLMs in mining assertions. Specifically, it performs AST-based structural extraction to derive the module call graph, I/O table, and dataflow graph, guiding the LLM to generate module-level specifications and mine module-level assertions. Our evaluation demonstrates that AssertMiner outperforms existing methods such as AssertLLM and Spec2Assertion in generating high-quality assertions for modules. When integrated with these methods, AssertMiner can enhance the structural coverage and significantly improve the error detection capability, enabling a more comprehensive and efficient verification process."}

As AI models, particularly Deep Neural Networks (DNNs), have grown in complexity, their massive computational demands have pushed traditional architectures to their limits. This paper provides a structured review of this co-evolution, analyzing the architectural landscape designed to accelerate modern AI workloads. We explore the dominant architectural paradigms Graphics Processing Units (GPUs), Appli-cation-Specific Integrated Circuits (ASICs), and Field-Programmable Gate Ar-rays (FPGAs) by breaking down their design philosophies, key features, and per-formance trade-offs. The core principles essential for performance and energy efficiency, including dataflow optimization, advanced memory hierarchies, spar-sity, and quantization, are analyzed. Furthermore, this paper looks ahead to emerging technologies such as Processing-in-Memory (PIM) and neuromorphic computing, which may redefine future computation. By synthesizing architec-tural principles with quantitative performance data from industry-standard benchmarks, this survey presents a comprehensive picture of the AI accelerator landscape. We conclude that AI and computer architecture are in a symbiotic relationship, where hardware-software co-design is no longer an optimization but a necessity for future progress in computing."}

On the other hand, computing has become essential for some research for various scientific fields, that require Supercomputers with vast computing capabilities to produce results in reasonable time. The scale and complexity of these systems, compared to our day-to-day devices, are like comparing a cell to a living organism. To make them work properly, we need state-of-the-art technology and engineering, not just raw resources. Interconnecting the different computer nodes that make up a whole is a delicate task, as it can become the bottleneck for the whole infrastructure. In this work, we explore two aspects of the network: how to prevent degradation under heavy use with congestion control, and how to save energy when idle with power management; and how the two may interact."}

Their deployment, however, is expected to incur excessive baseband processing hardware cost and power consumption. Beamspace processing leverages the channel sparsity at mmWave frequencies to reduce baseband processing complexity. In this paper, we review existing beamspace data detection algorithms and propose new algorithms as well as corresponding VLSI architectures that reduce data detection power. We present VLSI implementation results for the proposed architectures in a 22nm FDSOI process. Our results demonstrate that a fully-parallelized implementation of the proposed complex sparsity-adaptive equalizer (CSPADE) achieves up to 54% power savings compared to antenna-domain equalization. Furthermore, our fully-parallelized designs achieve the highest reported throughput among existing massive MIMO data detectors, while achieving better energy and area efficiency. We also present a sequential multiply-accumulate (MAC)-based architecture for CSPADE, which enables even higher power savings, i.e., up to 66%, compared to a MAC-based antenna-domain equalizer."}
