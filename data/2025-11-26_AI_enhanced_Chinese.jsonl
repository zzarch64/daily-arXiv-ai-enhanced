While large LLCs can reduce average memory access latency for workloads with a high degree of locality, they can also increase latency for workloads with irregular memory access patterns. Prefetchers are widely used to reduce memory latency by prefetching data into the cache hierarchy before it is accessed by the core. However, existing prediction-based prefetchers often struggle with irregular memory access patterns, which are especially prevalent in modern applications. This paper introduces the Pickle Prefetcher, a programmable and scalable LLC prefetcher designed to handle independent irregular memory access patterns effectively. Instead of relying on static heuristics or complex prediction algorithms, Pickle Prefetcher allows software to define its own prefetching strategies using a simple programming interface without expanding the instruction set architecture (ISA). By trading the logic complexity of hardware prediction for software programmability, Pickle Prefetcher can adapt to a wide range of access patterns without requiring extensive hardware resources for prediction. This allows the prefetcher to dedicate its resources to scheduling and issuing timely prefetch requests. Graph applications are an example where the memory access pattern is irregular but easily predictable by software. Through extensive evaluations of the Pickle Prefetcher on gem5 full-system simulations, we demonstrate tha Pickle Prefetcher significantly outperforms traditional prefetching techniques. Our results show that Pickle Prefetcher achieves speedups of up to 1.74x on the GAPBS breadth-first search (BFS) implementation over a baseline system. When combined with private cache prefetchers, Pickle Prefetcher provides up to a 1.40x speedup over systems using only private cache prefetchers.", "AI": {"tldr": "Pickle Prefetcher\u662f\u4e00\u4e2a\u53ef\u7f16\u7a0b\u7684LLC\u9884\u53d6\u5668\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u8f6f\u4ef6\u5b9a\u4e49\u9884\u53d6\u7b56\u7565\u6765\u5904\u7406\u4e0d\u89c4\u5219\u5185\u5b58\u8bbf\u95ee\u6a21\u5f0f\uff0c\u76f8\u6bd4\u4f20\u7edf\u9884\u53d6\u6280\u672f\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u6027\u80fd\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u4ee3\u9ad8\u6027\u80fd\u67b6\u6784\u4f7f\u7528\u5927\u578b\u672b\u7ea7\u7f13\u5b58\uff0c\u4f46\u4f20\u7edf\u57fa\u4e8e\u9884\u6d4b\u7684\u9884\u53d6\u5668\u96be\u4ee5\u5904\u7406\u73b0\u4ee3\u5e94\u7528\u4e2d\u666e\u904d\u5b58\u5728\u7684\u4e0d\u89c4\u5219\u5185\u5b58\u8bbf\u95ee\u6a21\u5f0f\u3002", "method": "\u91c7\u7528\u8f6f\u4ef6\u53ef\u7f16\u7a0b\u63a5\u53e3\uff0c\u8ba9\u8f6f\u4ef6\u5b9a\u4e49\u81ea\u5df1\u7684\u9884\u53d6\u7b56\u7565\uff0c\u800c\u4e0d\u4f9d\u8d56\u9759\u6001\u542f\u53d1\u5f0f\u6216\u590d\u6742\u9884\u6d4b\u7b97\u6cd5\uff0c\u5c06\u786c\u4ef6\u9884\u6d4b\u7684\u903b\u8f91\u590d\u6742\u6027\u8f6c\u5316\u4e3a\u8f6f\u4ef6\u53ef\u7f16\u7a0b\u6027\u3002", "result": "\u5728gem5\u5168\u7cfb\u7edf\u6a21\u62df\u4e2d\uff0cPickle Prefetcher\u5728GAPBS\u5e7f\u5ea6\u4f18\u5148\u641c\u7d22\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e0a\u6bd4\u57fa\u7ebf\u7cfb\u7edf\u83b7\u5f97\u6700\u9ad81.74\u500d\u52a0\u901f\uff0c\u4e0e\u79c1\u6709\u7f13\u5b58\u9884\u53d6\u5668\u7ed3\u5408\u65f6\u6bd4\u4ec5\u4f7f\u7528\u79c1\u6709\u7f13\u5b58\u9884\u53d6\u5668\u7684\u7cfb\u7edf\u63d0\u4f9b\u6700\u9ad81.40\u500d\u52a0\u901f\u3002", "conclusion": "\u901a\u8fc7\u8f6f\u4ef6\u53ef\u7f16\u7a0b\u6027\uff0cPickle Prefetcher\u80fd\u591f\u6709\u6548\u5904\u7406\u4e0d\u89c4\u5219\u5185\u5b58\u8bbf\u95ee\u6a21\u5f0f\uff0c\u5728\u4fdd\u6301\u786c\u4ef6\u8d44\u6e90\u6548\u7387\u7684\u540c\u65f6\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u6027\u80fd\u3002"}}

Traditional automatic program repair (APR) methods define dedicated search spaces to locate and fix bugs with program synthesis. However, they heavily rely on fixed templates and can only deal with limited bugs. As an alternative, Large Language Models with the ability to understand code semantics can be explored for RTL repair. However, they suffer from unreliable outcomes due to inherent randomness and long input contexts of RTL code and waveform. To address these challenges, we propose R3A, an LLM-based automatic RTL program repair framework upon the basic model to improve reliability. R3A proposes the stochastic Tree-Of-Thoughts method to control a patch generation agent to explore a validated solution for the bug. The algorithm samples search states according to a heuristic function to balance between exploration and exploitation for a reliable outcome. Besides, R3A proposes a multi-agent fault localization method to find fault candidates as the starting points for the patch generation agent, further increasing the reliability. Experiments show R3A can fix 90.6% of bugs in the RTL-repair dataset within a given time limit, which covers 45% more bugs than traditional methods and other LLM-based approaches, while achieving an 86.7% pass@5 rate on average, showing a high reliability.", "AI": {"tldr": "R3A\u662f\u4e00\u4e2a\u57fa\u4e8e\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u7684RTL\u81ea\u52a8\u7a0b\u5e8f\u4fee\u590d\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u968f\u673a\u6811\u641c\u7d22\u548c\u591a\u667a\u80fd\u4f53\u6545\u969c\u5b9a\u4f4d\u63d0\u9ad8\u4fee\u590d\u53ef\u9760\u6027\uff0c\u5728RTL-repair\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4e0a\u4fee\u590d\u4e8690.6%\u7684bug\uff0c\u6bd4\u4f20\u7edf\u65b9\u6cd5\u591a\u4fee\u590d45%\u7684bug\u3002", "motivation": "\u4f20\u7edf\u81ea\u52a8\u7a0b\u5e8f\u4fee\u590d\u65b9\u6cd5\u4f9d\u8d56\u56fa\u5b9a\u6a21\u677f\uff0c\u53ea\u80fd\u5904\u7406\u6709\u9650\u7684bug\uff1b\u800c\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u867d\u7136\u80fd\u7406\u89e3\u4ee3\u7801\u8bed\u4e49\uff0c\u4f46\u7531\u4e8e\u968f\u673a\u6027\u548cRTL\u4ee3\u7801\u53ca\u6ce2\u5f62\u7684\u957f\u8f93\u5165\u4e0a\u4e0b\u6587\uff0c\u4fee\u590d\u7ed3\u679c\u4e0d\u53ef\u9760\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51faR3A\u6846\u67b6\uff1a1\uff09\u4f7f\u7528\u968f\u673a\u6811\u641c\u7d22\u65b9\u6cd5\u63a7\u5236\u8865\u4e01\u751f\u6210\u667a\u80fd\u4f53\u63a2\u7d22\u9a8c\u8bc1\u89e3\u51b3\u65b9\u6848\uff1b2\uff09\u57fa\u4e8e\u542f\u53d1\u5f0f\u51fd\u6570\u91c7\u6837\u641c\u7d22\u72b6\u6001\u4ee5\u5e73\u8861\u63a2\u7d22\u4e0e\u5229\u7528\uff1b3\uff09\u591a\u667a\u80fd\u4f53\u6545\u969c\u5b9a\u4f4d\u65b9\u6cd5\u627e\u5230\u6545\u969c\u5019\u9009\u70b9\u4f5c\u4e3a\u8865\u4e01\u751f\u6210\u7684\u8d77\u70b9\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u7ed9\u5b9a\u65f6\u95f4\u9650\u5236\u5185\u4fee\u590d\u4e86RTL-repair\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4e2d90.6%\u7684bug\uff0c\u6bd4\u4f20\u7edf\u65b9\u6cd5\u548c\u5176\u4ed6\u57fa\u4e8eLLM\u7684\u65b9\u6cd5\u591a\u4fee\u590d45%\u7684bug\uff0c\u5e73\u5747\u8fbe\u523086.7%\u7684pass@5\u7387\u3002", "conclusion": "R3A\u901a\u8fc7\u7ed3\u5408\u968f\u673a\u6811\u641c\u7d22\u548c\u591a\u667a\u80fd\u4f53\u6545\u969c\u5b9a\u4f4d\uff0c\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u9ad8\u4e86\u57fa\u4e8eLLM\u7684RTL\u7a0b\u5e8f\u4fee\u590d\u7684\u53ef\u9760\u6027\uff0c\u5728\u4fee\u590d\u7387\u548c\u6210\u529f\u7387\u65b9\u9762\u90fd\u4f18\u4e8e\u73b0\u6709\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002"}}
