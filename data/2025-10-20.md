  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 纠正Mess论文中关于Ramulator 2.0模拟器的错误结论，指出其配置和使用中的多个简单人为错误，维护计算机架构领域科学记录的可靠性。

Method: 通过重新正确配置Ramulator 2.0模拟器，对比分析Mess论文中的错误配置和正确配置下的模拟结果差异，并检查DAMOV模拟统计数据的正确性。

Result: 证明正确配置的Ramulator 2.0能够准确模拟内存系统性能，与真实系统特征相符；发现Mess论文中DAMOV模拟使用了与DRAM性能无关的错误统计；Mess论文的代码库缺乏完整复现所需资源。

Conclusion: 强调严谨验证模拟结果的重要性，建议与模拟器开发者沟通确保正确使用，呼吁社区纠正Mess论文的错误以防止错误结果的传播，并对评审和制品评估过程的完整性提出质疑。

Abstract: A MICRO 2024 best paper runner-up publication (the Mess paper) with all three
artifact badges awarded (including "Reproducible") proposes a new benchmark to
evaluate real and simulated memory system performance. In this paper, we
demonstrate that the Ramulator 2.0 simulation results reported in the Mess
paper are incorrect and, at the time of the publication of the Mess paper,
irreproducible. We find that the authors of Mess paper made multiple trivial
human errors in both the configuration and usage of the simulators. We show
that by correctly configuring Ramulator 2.0, Ramulator 2.0's simulated memory
system performance actually resembles real system characteristics well, and
thus a key claimed contribution of the Mess paper is factually incorrect. We
also identify that the DAMOV simulation results in the Mess paper use wrong
simulation statistics that are unrelated to the simulated DRAM performance.
Moreover, the Mess paper's artifact repository lacks the necessary sources to
fully reproduce all the Mess paper's results.
  Our work corrects the Mess paper's errors regarding Ramulator 2.0 and
identifies important issues in the Mess paper's memory simulator evaluation
methodology. We emphasize the importance of both carefully and rigorously
validating simulation results and contacting simulator authors and developers,
in true open source spirit, to ensure these simulators are used with correct
configurations and as intended. We encourage the computer architecture
community to correct the Mess paper's errors. This is necessary to prevent the
propagation of inaccurate and misleading results, and to maintain the
reliability of the scientific record. Our investigation also opens up questions
about the integrity of the review and artifact evaluation processes. To aid
future work, our source code and scripts are openly available at https:
