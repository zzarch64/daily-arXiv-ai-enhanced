While\nchiplet-based approaches have been proposed to amortize NRE costs, reuse\nopportunities remain limited without carefully identifying which chiplets are\ntruly necessary. This paper introduces Mozart, a chiplet ecosystem and\naccelerator codesign framework that systematically constructs low cost bespoke\napplication-specific integrated circuits (BASICs). BASICs leverage\noperator-level disaggregation to explore chiplet and memory heterogeneity,\ntensor fusion, and tensor parallelism, with place-and-route validation ensuring\nphysical implementability. The framework also enables constraint-aware\nsystem-level optimization across deployment contexts ranging from datacenter\ninference serving to edge computing in autonomous vehicles. The evaluation\nconfirms that with just 8 strategically selected chiplets, Mozart-generated\ncomposite BASICs achieve 43.5%, 25.4%, 67.7%, and 78.8% reductions in energy,\nenergy-cost product, energy-delay product (EDP), and energy-delay-cost product\ncompared to traditional homogeneous accelerators. For datacenter LLM serving,\nMozart achieves 15-19% energy reduction and 35-39% energy-cost improvement. In\nspeculative decoding, Mozart delivers throughput improvements of 24.6-58.6%\nwhile reducing energy consumption by 38.6-45.6%. For autonomous vehicle\nperception, Mozart reduces energy-cost by 25.54% and energy by 10.53% under\nreal-time constraints."}

As a\nconsequence, they rely on external devices for additional processing\ncapability. This dependence on external processing places a significant\ncommunication burden on the sequencer's embedded electronics.

While\nquantization methods and hardware accelerators have been proposed to enhance\nNeRF's computational efficiency, existing approaches face crucial limitations.\nCurrent quantization methods operate without considering hardware architecture,\nresulting in sub-optimal solutions within the vast design space encompassing\naccuracy, latency, and model size. Additionally, existing NeRF accelerators\nheavily rely on human experts to explore this design space, making the\noptimization process time-consuming, inefficient, and unlikely to discover\noptimal solutions. To address these challenges, we introduce HERO, a\nreinforcement learning framework performing hardware-aware quantization for\nNeRF. Our framework integrates a NeRF accelerator simulator to generate\nreal-time hardware feedback, enabling fully automated adaptation to hardware\nconstraints. Experimental results demonstrate that HERO achieves 1.31-1.33\n$\\times$ better latency, 1.29-1.33 $\\times$ improved cost efficiency, and a\nmore compact model size compared to CAQ, a previous state-of-the-art NeRF\nquantization framework.
