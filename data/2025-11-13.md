Abstract: AI systems have found a wide range of real-world applications in recent years. The adoption of edge artificial intelligence, embedding AI directly into edge devices, is rapidly growing. Despite the implementation of guardrails and safety mechanisms, security vulnerabilities and challenges have become increasingly prevalent in this domain, posing a significant barrier to the practical deployment and safety of AI systems. This paper proposes an agentic AI safety architecture that leverages 3D to integrate a dedicated safety layer. It introduces an adaptive AI safety infrastructure capable of dynamically learning and mitigating attacks against the AI system. The system leverages the inherent advantages of co-location with the edge computing hardware to continuously monitor, detect and proactively mitigate threats to the AI system. The integration of local processing and learning capabilities enhances resilience against emerging network-based attacks while simultaneously improving system reliability, modularity, and performance, all with minimal cost and 3D integration overhead.

Abstract: Simulation-based fault injection is a widely adopted methodology for assessing circuit vulnerability to Single Event Upsets (SEUs); however, its computational cost grows significantly with circuit complexity. To address this limitation, this work introduces an open-source platform that exploits Spatio-Temporal Graph Neural Networks (STGNNs) to accelerate SEU fault simulation. The platform includes three STGNN architectures incorporating advanced components such as Atrous Spatial Pyramid Pooling (ASPP) and attention mechanisms, thereby improving spatio-temporal feature extraction. In addition, SEU fault simulation datasets are constructed from six open-source circuits with varying levels of complexity, providing a comprehensive benchmark for performance evaluation. The predictive capability of the STGNN models is analyzed and compared on these datasets. Moreover, to further investigate the efficiency of the approach, we evaluate the predictive capability of STGNNs across multiple test cases and discuss their generalization capability. The developed platform and datasets are released as open-source to support reproducibility and further research on https://github.com/luli2021/FsimNNs.
