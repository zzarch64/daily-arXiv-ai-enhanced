Tensil-based conventional design environments limited hardware implementations to fixed-point bit-widths of 16 or 32 bits. To address this, we adopt the FINN framework, enabling implementations with arbitrary bit-widths. Several customizations and minor adjustments are made, including: 1.Optimization of Transpose nodes to resolve data format mismatches, 2.Addition of handling for converting the final reduce mean operation to Global Average Pooling (GAP). These adjustments allow us to reduce the bit-width while maintaining the same accuracy as the conventional realization, and achieve approximately twice the throughput in evaluations using CIFAR-10 dataset."}

However, many popular matrix-based kernels need to execute non-MVM operations, which analog PUM cannot directly perform. To retain its energy efficiency, analog PUM architectures augment memory arrays with CMOS-based domain-specific fixed-function hardware to provide complete kernel functionality, but the difficulty of integrating such specialized CMOS logic with memory arrays has largely limited analog PUM to being an accelerator for machine learning inference, or for closely related kernels. An opportunity exists to harness analog PUM for general-purpose computation: recent works have shown that memory arrays can also perform Boolean PUM operations, albeit with very different supporting hardware and electrical signals than analog PUM.\n  We propose DARTH-PUM, a general-purpose hybrid PUM architecture that tackles key hardware and software challenges to integrating analog PUM and digital PUM. We propose optimized peripheral circuitry, coordinating hardware to manage and interface between both types of PUM, an easy-to-use programming interface, and low-cost support for flexible data widths. These design elements allow us to build a practical PUM architecture that can execute kernels fully in memory, and can scale easily to cater to domains ranging from embedded applications to large-scale data-driven computing. We show how three popular applications (AES encryption, convolutional neural networks, large-language models) can map to and benefit from DARTH-PUM, with speedups of 59.4x, 14.8x, and 40.8x over an analog+CPU baseline."}

This paper presents an energy-efficient FPGA architecture for stochastic simulated quantum annealing (SSQA) that addresses these challenges. The proposed design combines a spin-serial and replica-parallel update schedule with a dual-BRAM delay-line architecture, enabling scalable support for fully connected Ising models while eliminating fan-out growth in logic resources. By exploiting SSQA, the architecture achieves fast convergence using only final replica states, significantly reducing memory requirements compared to conventional p-bit-based annealers. Implemented on a Xilinx ZC706 FPGA, the proposed system solves an 800-node MAX-CUT benchmark and achieves up to 50% reduction in energy consumption and over 90\\% reduction in logic resources compared with prior FPGA-based p-bit annealing architectures. These results demonstrate the practicality of quantum-inspired, p-bit-based annealing hardware for large-scale combinatorial optimization under strict energy and resource constraints."}
