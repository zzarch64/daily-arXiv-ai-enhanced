As\nmulti-chiplet designs become the norm for scaling compute capabilities, memory\nlatency and bandwidth vary sharply across compute regions, undermining the\nperformance of traditional GPU kernel scheduling strategies that assume uniform\nmemory access. We identify how these NUMA effects distort locality in\nmulti-head attention (MHA) and present Swizzled Head-first Mapping, a\nspatially-aware scheduling strategy that aligns attention heads with GPU NUMA\ndomains to exploit intra-chiplet cache reuse. On AMD's MI300X architecture, our\nmethod achieves up to 50% higher performance over state-of-the-art attention\nalgorithms using conventional scheduling techniques and sustains consistently\nhigh L2 cache hit rates of 80-97%. These results demonstrate that NUMA-aware\nscheduling is now fundamental to achieving full efficiency on next-generation\ndisaggregated GPUs, offering a path forward for scalable AI training and\ninference."}

This gives more room for exploration in logic\noptimization, while also posing a challenge for tasks involving consistency\nbetween Boolean networks. To tackle this challenge, we introduce BoolSkeleton,\na novel Boolean network skeletonization method that improves the consistency\nand reliability of design-specific evaluations. BoolSkeleton comprises two key\nsteps: preprocessing and reduction. In preprocessing, the Boolean network is\ntransformed into a defined Boolean dependency graph, where nodes are assigned\nthe functionality-related status. Next, the homogeneous and heterogeneous\npatterns are defined for the node-level pattern reduction step. Heterogeneous\npatterns are preserved to maintain critical functionality-related dependencies,\nwhile homogeneous patterns can be reduced. Parameter K of the pattern further\nconstrains the fanin size of these patterns, enabling fine-tuned control over\nthe granularity of graph reduction. To validate BoolSkeleton's effectiveness,\nwe conducted four analysis/downstream tasks around the Boolean network:\ncompression analysis, classification, critical path analysis, and timing\nprediction, demonstrating its robustness across diverse scenarios. Furthermore,\nit improves above 55% in the average accuracy compared to the original Boolean\nnetwork for the timing prediction task. These experiments underscore the\npotential of BoolSkeleton to enhance design consistency in logic synthesis."}

We propose VFocus, a three-stage\nframework that enhances Verilog generation by sharpening the focus of LLM\nreasoning onto critical decision points in the code generation process. In the\n\\textbf{pre-ranking stage}, VFocus generates multiple code candidates through\nLLM prompting, retries for syntactically valid outputs, and introduces a\n\\textit{Density-guided Filtering} to retain candidates that fall within the\n\"reasoning sweet spot\" for functional correctness. In the \\textbf{ranking\nstage}, we simulate each code candidate using an automatically generated\ntestbench and apply self-consistency-based clustering to identify the most\nconsistent outputs. Finally, in the \\textbf{post-ranking refinement stage},\nVFocus performs inconsistency mining on top-ranked candidates and invokes\nreasoning-augmented LLM prompts for candidate refinement. Experiments on the\nVerilogEval-Human benchmark show that VFocus significantly improves the pass@1\ncorrectness across multiple reasoning LLMs, demonstrating its effectiveness in\nenhancing Verilog generation for complex hardware design tasks."}

The system consists of two steps: one for face detection step and one\nfor facial expression recognition. In the previous work, the Haar Cascade\ndetector was run on a CPU in the face detection step due to FPGA resource\nlimitations, but this detector is less accurate for profile and variable\nillumination condition images. Moreover, the previous work used a dedicated\ncircuit accelerator, so running a second DNN inference for face detection on\nthe FPGA would require the addition of a new accelerator. As an alternative to\nthis approach, we run the two inferences by DNN on a DPU, which is a\ngeneral-purpose CNN accelerator of the systolic array type. Our method for face\ndetection using DenseBox and facial expression recognition using CNN on the\nsame DPU enables the efficient use of FPGA resources while maintaining a small\ncircuit size. We also developed a multi-threading technique that improves the\noverall throughput while increasing the DPU utilization efficiency. With this\napproach, we achieved an overall system throughput of 25 FPS and a throughput\nper power consumption of 2.4 times."}
