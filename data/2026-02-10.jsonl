Simultaneously, the popularity of Large-Language-Models (LLMs) drives the adoption of low-bit floating-point formats which prioritize dynamic range. However, the conventional direct-accumulation CIM accommodates floating-points by normalizing them to a shared widened fixed-point scale. Consequently, hardware resolution is dictated by the input's dynamic range rather than its precision, and energy consumption is dominated by the ADC. We address this limitation by introducing local normalization for each input, weight, and multiply-accumulate (MAC) output via a Gain-Ranging MAC (GR-MAC). Normalization overhead is handled by low-power digital logic, enabling the computationally expensive MAC operation to remain in the energy-efficient low-precision analog regime. Energy modelling shows that the addition of a gain-ranging Stage to the MAC enables a 4-bit increase in input dynamic range without increased energy consumption at a 35 dB SQNR standard. Additionally, the ADC resolution requirement becomes invariant to input distribution assumptions, allowing construction of an upper bound with a 1.5-bit reduction compared to the conventional lower bound. These results establish a pathway towards unlocking favourable energy scaling trends of analog CIM for modern AI workloads."}

We present the first end-to-end AFMTJ simulation framework integrating multi-sublattice Landau-Lifshitz-Gilbert (LLG) dynamics with circuit-level modeling. SPICE-based simulations show that AFMTJs achieve ~8x lower write latency and ~9x lower write energy than conventional MTJs. When integrated into an in-memory computing architecture, AFMTJs deliver 17.5x average speedup and nearly 20x energy savings versus a CPU baseline-significantly outperforming MTJ-based IMC. These results establish AFMTJs as a compelling primitive for scalable, low-power computing."}

Even though simulation is omnipresent in the development and validation life cycle of automated and connected driving technology, the complex nature of public road traffic and software that masters it still requires real-world integration and testing with actual vehicles. Dedicated vehicles for research and development allow testing and validation of software and hardware components under real-world conditions early on. They also enable collecting and publishing real-world datasets that let others conduct research without vehicle access, and support early demonstration of futuristic use cases. In this paper, we present karl., our new research vehicle for automated and connected driving. Apart from major corporations, few institutions worldwide have access to their own L4-capable research vehicles, restricting their ability to carry out independent research. This paper aims to help bridge that gap by sharing the reasoning, design choices, and technical details that went into making karl. a flexible and powerful platform for research, engineering, and validation in the context of automated and connected driving.
