We focus on\n''transferrable'' task representations -- vector representations that can\nrestore task context in another instance of the model, even without the full\nprompt.

Specifically, models often\ncondense multiple evidence into these transferrable task representations, which\nalign well with the performance improvement based on more examples in the\ncontext. However, this accrual process exhibits strong locality along the\nsequence dimension, coming online only at certain tokens -- despite task\nidentity being reliably decodable throughout the context.

While effective, this approach encounters a\nsignificant bottleneck as computation increases, where further computation\noffers only marginal performance gains. We argue this ceiling is not an\ninherent limit of the model's capability but a flaw in the scaling strategy\nitself, a phenomenon we term \"Tunnel Vision\", where a model's imperfect initial\nsteps lock it into a suboptimal reasoning path. To overcome this, we introduce\na new scaling paradigm: native thought parallelism. We present ParaThinker, an\nend-to-end framework that trains an LLM to generate multiple, diverse reasoning\npaths in parallel and synthesize them into a superior final answer. By\nexploring different lines of thoughts simultaneously, ParaThinker effectively\nsidesteps the Tunnel Vision issue and unlocks the model's latent reasoning\npotential. Our approach demonstrates that scaling compute in parallel (width)\nis a more effective and efficient way to superior reasoning than simply scaling\nsequentially (depth). On challenging reasoning benchmarks, ParaThinker achieves\nsubstantial accuracy improvements over sequential LLMs (12.3% for 1.5B and 7.5%\nfor 7B models on average with 8 parallel paths), while adding only negligible\nlatency overhead (7.1%). This enables smaller models to surpass much larger\ncounterparts and establishes parallel thinking as a critical, efficient\ndimension for scaling future LLMs."}

While significant\nprogress has been made in advancing speech generation pipelines, limited work\nhas addressed the recognition and downstream processing of synthesized speech,\nwhich often suffers from phonetic ambiguity and noise. To overcome these\nchallenges, we propose an enhanced automatic speech recognition framework that\ncombines a transformer-based acoustic model with a large language model (LLM)\nfor post-processing. The transformer captures full utterance context, while the\nLLM ensures linguistic consistency. Experimental results show a 16% relative\nand 6% absolute reduction in word error rate (WER) over a 36% baseline,\ndemonstrating substantial improvements in intelligibility for silent speech\ninterfaces."}

Unfortunately, applying modern Natural Language Processing\nand Machine Learning techniques to analyse triage data faces some challenges:\nFirstly, hospital data contains highly sensitive information that is subject to\nprivacy regulation thus need to be analysed on site; Secondly, most hospitals\nand medical facilities lack the necessary hardware to fine-tune a Large\nLanguage Model (LLM), much less training one from scratch; Lastly, to identify\nthe records of interest, expert inputs are needed to manually label the\ndatasets, which can be time-consuming and costly. We present in this paper a\npipeline that enables the classification of triage data using LLM and limited\ncompute resources.
