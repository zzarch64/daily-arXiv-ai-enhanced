However, prior evaluations have largely relied on simulators or\nsmall prototypes, limiting the understanding of their real-world potential. In\nthis work, we present a comprehensive performance and energy characterization\nof a commercial compute-in-SRAM device, the GSI APU, under realistic workloads.\nWe compare the GSI APU against established architectures, including CPUs and\nGPUs, to quantify its energy efficiency and performance potential. We introduce\nan analytical framework for general-purpose compute-in-SRAM devices that\nreveals fundamental optimization principles by modeling performance trade-offs,\nthereby guiding program optimizations.\n  Exploiting the fine-grained parallelism of tightly integrated memory-compute\narchitectures requires careful data management. We address this by proposing\nthree optimizations: communication-aware reduction mapping, coalesced DMA, and\nbroadcast-friendly data layouts. When applied to retrieval-augmented generation\n(RAG) over large corpora (10GB--200GB), these optimizations enable our\ncompute-in-SRAM system to accelerate retrieval by 4.8$\\times$--6.6$\\times$ over\nan optimized CPU baseline, improving end-to-end RAG latency by\n1.1$\\times$--1.8$\\times$. The shared off-chip memory bandwidth is modeled using\na simulated HBM, while all other components are measured on the real\ncompute-in-SRAM device. Critically, this system matches the performance of an\nNVIDIA A6000 GPU for RAG while being significantly more energy-efficient\n(54.4$\\times$-117.9$\\times$ reduction). These findings validate the viability\nof compute-in-SRAM for complex, real-world applications and provide guidance\nfor advancing the technology."}

However, for edge devices even inference has too large\ncomputational complexity and data access amount. The inference latency of\nstate-of-the-art models are impractical for real-world applications. In this\npaper, we propose a high utilization energy-aware real-time inference deep\nconvolutional neural network accelerator, which improves the performance of the\ncurrent accelerators. First, we use the 1x1 size convolution kernel as the\nsmallest unit of the computing unit. Then we design suitable computing unit\nbased on the requirements of each model. Secondly, we use Reuse Feature SRAM to\nstore the output of the current layer in the chip and use the value as the\ninput of the next layer. Moreover, we import Output Reuse Strategy and Ring\nStream Dataflow to reduce the amount of data exchange between chips and DRAM.\nFinally, we present On-fly Pooling Module to let the calculation of the Pooling\nlayer directly complete in the chip. With the aid of the proposed method, the\nimplemented acceleration chip has an extremely high hardware utilization rate.\nWe reduce a generous amount of data transfer on the specific module, ECNN.\nCompared to the methods without reuse strategy, we can reduce 533 times of data\naccess amount.

In\nparticular, we recognize that ECC chips (used for parity storage) do not\nnecessarily require the same performance level as regular data chips. This\noffers two-fold benefits: First, the bandwidth originally provisioned for a\nregular-performance ECC chip can instead be used to accommodate multiple\nlow-performance chips. Second, the cost of ECC chips can be effectively\nreduced, as lower performance often correlates with lower expense. In addition,\nwe observe that server-class memory chips are often provisioned with ample, yet\nunderutilized I/O resources. This further offers the opportunity to repurpose\nthese resources to enable flexible on-DIMM interconnections. Based on the above\ntwo insights, we finally propose SCREME, a scalable memory framework leverages\ncost-effective, albeit slower, chips -- naturally produced during rapid\ntechnology evolution -- to meet the growing reliability demands driven by this\nevolution."}

However,\nthe computational complexity of pMRI, especially in image reconstruction and\nmachine learning (ML) algorithms for enhanced imaging, presents significant\nchallenges. Such challenges can be potentially addressed by harnessing hardware\napplication solutions, though there is little focus in the current pMRI\nliterature on hardware acceleration. This paper bridges that gap by reviewing\nrecent developments in pMRI, emphasizing the role and impact of hardware\nacceleration to speed up image acquisition and reconstruction. Key technologies\nsuch as Graphics Processing Units (GPUs), Field-Programmable Gate Arrays\n(FPGAs), and Application-Specific Integrated Circuits (ASICs) offer excellent\nperformance in terms of reconstruction speed and power consumption. This review\nalso highlights the promise of AI-powered reconstruction, open low-field pMRI\ndatasets, and innovative edge-based hardware solutions for the future of pMRI\ntechnology. Overall, hardware acceleration can enhance image quality, reduce\npower consumption, and increase portability for next-generation pMRI\ntechnology. To accelerate reproducible AI for portable MRI, we propose forming\na Low-Field MRI Consortium and an evidence ladder (analytic/phantom validation,\nretrospective multi-center testing, prospective reader and non-inferiority\ntrials) to provide standardized datasets, benchmarks, and regulator-ready\ntestbeds."}
