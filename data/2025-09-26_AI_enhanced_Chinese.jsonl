Due to this availability, many\nfree and open-source implementations have been developed and can be accessed on\nplatforms such as GitHub. If an open source, easy-to-use, and robust RISC-V\nimplementation could be obtained, it could be easily adapted for pedagogical\nand amateur use. In this work we accomplish three goals in relation to this\noutlook. First, we propose a set of criteria for evaluating the components of a\nRISC-V implementation's ecosystem from a pedagogical perspective. Second, we\nanalyze a number of existing open-source RISC-V implementations to determine\nhow many of the criteria they fulfill. We then develop a comprehensive solution\nthat meets all of these criterion and is released open-source for other\ninstructors to use. The framework is developed in a composable way that it's\ndifferent components can be disaggregated per individual course needs. Finally,\nwe also report on a limited study of student feedback.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u4e2a\u8bc4\u4f30RISC-V\u5b9e\u73b0\u751f\u6001\u7cfb\u7edf\u7684\u6807\u51c6\uff0c\u5206\u6790\u4e86\u73b0\u6709\u5f00\u6e90\u5b9e\u73b0\uff0c\u5e76\u5f00\u53d1\u4e86\u4e00\u4e2a\u6ee1\u8db3\u6240\u6709\u6807\u51c6\u7684\u53ef\u7ec4\u5408\u6559\u5b66\u6846\u67b6\u3002", "motivation": "RISC-V ISA\u4f5c\u4e3a\u514d\u8d39\u5f00\u6e90\u66ff\u4ee3\u65b9\u6848\uff0c\u9700\u8981\u4e00\u4e2a\u6613\u4e8e\u4f7f\u7528\u4e14\u7a33\u5065\u7684\u5b9e\u73b0\u6765\u9002\u5e94\u6559\u5b66\u548c\u4e1a\u4f59\u4f7f\u7528\u9700\u6c42\u3002", "method": "\u9996\u5148\u63d0\u51fa\u6559\u5b66\u89c6\u89d2\u7684\u8bc4\u4f30\u6807\u51c6\uff0c\u7136\u540e\u5206\u6790\u73b0\u6709\u5f00\u6e90RISC-V\u5b9e\u73b0\uff0c\u6700\u540e\u5f00\u53d1\u6ee1\u8db3\u6240\u6709\u6807\u51c6\u7684\u53ef\u7ec4\u5408\u6846\u67b6\u3002", "result": "\u5f00\u53d1\u4e86\u4e00\u4e2a\u5168\u9762\u7684\u5f00\u6e90\u89e3\u51b3\u65b9\u6848\uff0c\u5176\u7ec4\u4ef6\u53ef\u4ee5\u6839\u636e\u8bfe\u7a0b\u9700\u6c42\u8fdb\u884c\u5206\u89e3\u4f7f\u7528\uff0c\u5e76\u6536\u96c6\u4e86\u5b66\u751f\u53cd\u9988\u3002", "conclusion": "\u6210\u529f\u521b\u5efa\u4e86\u4e00\u4e2a\u6ee1\u8db3\u6559\u5b66\u9700\u6c42\u7684RISC-V\u5b9e\u73b0\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u4e3a\u5176\u4ed6\u6559\u80b2\u5de5\u4f5c\u8005\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u53ef\u7528\u7684\u5f00\u6e90\u8d44\u6e90\u3002"}}

Most often, silicon\ncharacterizations comprise simple performance counters, which are aggregated\nand separated to tell a story. Based on these inferences, performance engineers\nemploy microarchitectural simulation to inspect deeply into the core.\nUnfortunately, dramatically longer runtimes make simulation infeasible for long\nworkloads.\n  We propose a Scale-Down approach to modelling and validation. Rather than\nup-sizing a prototyping platform to fit large and complex system designs, we\nshow that it can be more accurate, faster, and more economical to decompose a\nsystem into manageable sub-components that can be prototyped independently. By\ncarefully designing the prototyping interface, it is possible to adhere to\nstrict non-interference of the Device Under Test (DUT). This allows architects\nto have the best of both worlds: the speed of FPGA acceleration while\neliminating the inaccuracies of Scale-Out and the inherent costs of Scale-Up.\n  In this work, we present ZynqParrot: a Scale-Down FPGA-based modelling\nplatform, capable of executing non-interfering, cycle-accurate co-emulations of\narbitrary RTL designs. ZynqParrot is capable of verifying functionality and\nperformance with arbitrary granularity.
